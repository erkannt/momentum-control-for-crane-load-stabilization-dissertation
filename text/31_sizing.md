# Sizing CMGs for Cranes

## Input Parameters

- determine Nms
  - duration of robot tasks
  - duraton of pick and place vs. wind loads???
- determine Nm/s
  - agility of robot
  - swing reqs???
- determine baserate
- derive gimbal torque requirements:
  - from dynamics
  - from reaction torques
- tradeoff between passive stabilisation and gimbal sizing???

## Sizing Workflow

## Feasability Analysis

- gimbal torques
- gyro speeds and inertias
- size and weight of setup
