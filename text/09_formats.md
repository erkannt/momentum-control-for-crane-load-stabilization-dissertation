This dissertation is available as an HTML-file will all figures embedded, an EPUB ebook as well as a PDF.
The recommended format is HTML as this lets the reader not only adjust the font size as needed, but also allows for full screen figures and animated GIFs that illustrate complex motion more vividly than a graph.

All three formats where generated from markdown files converted with Pandoc.
The data, code for figure generation and content transformation as well a Dockerfile for the containerized build environment are available in a git repository.
