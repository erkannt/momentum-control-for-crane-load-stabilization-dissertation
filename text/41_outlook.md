> "When its time for helicopters, you get helicopters. Everywhere." -- Cory Doctorow

- cow is a sphere
  - ropes are flexible
  - no drag
  - no wind
- taking 2D to 3D
  - identify euler angle
  - apply torque
  - for sizing modelling workspace without internal singularities sufficient
- robot paths can be optimised
  - remain in torque workspace
  - limited Nm/s
  - limit Nm
  - minize Base Forces
- desaturation strategies
  - push off agains wall
  - desaturate using conventional pendulum dampening
- steering laws for crane CMG
  - 3DoF steering laws suited for application
  - optimize gimbal angle during trolley movement
- untilize not only predicted robot torque but also force in controller
- link pendulum to a gantry model
- apply higher performance control techniques
- engineering challenges
  - power at hook
  - high speed parts in construction suited package
  - vibrations
  - sensing hook and platform position
