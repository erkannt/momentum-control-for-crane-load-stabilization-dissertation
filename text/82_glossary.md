Singularity
:  In the context of mechanisms a singularity is a certain configuration or state of the moving parts where the control or modelling of the system breaks down to a certain degree.
This can mean that the behaviour after reaching the singularity is no longer predictable or that certain values become infinite or nondeterministic. 
An example of this for in an industrial robot can be seen in @Fig:singularity.


![Illustration of a singularity in a six-axis industrial robot. Once the two axis are in line they can in theory rotate an infinate amount with producing a lateral movement. The speed at which they have to rotate to maintain a constant lateral motion therefore also goes to infinity.
