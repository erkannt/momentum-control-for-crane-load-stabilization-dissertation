## Pendulum Simulation

### 2D Pendulum

We've already seen some of the interaction that occurs with a double pendulum in @Sec:2dpendulum, with the lower pendulum causing higher frequency oscillations to be overlaid.
Now let us look at how the parameters of the system affect its behavior.

### 3D Pendulum

- gyroscopic reaction causes rotation as we have no friction

### Pendulum-CMG Interaction

\missingfigure{CMG torques at different base rates}

- base rates vs. pendulum length vs. gyro inertia
- reaction torque vs. array design vs. CMG orientation
- explain why passive stabilisation is not possible

## Robot tasks

\missingfigure{selected robot task}


![Comparison of the base torques for the same path performed and two different speeds. At low speeds the longer time spent out of balance require a larger momentum envelope while higher robot speeds require greater gimbal agility to achieve the momentum dynamics.](./figures/robot-load-speedcomparison-plot.jpg){#fig:robot-load-speedcomparison-plot}


We can distinguish between three types of torque:

- torque from robot motion and its own inertia
- process forces transmitted from the tool to the base
- torque from imbalance

Conclusions:

- trade off between Nm/s and Nms due to time spent out of balance
- it might make sense to add sliding weight to keep COG inline with rope

## Hardware Experiments

### Prototype Setup

![CMGs used in the hardware prototype. The Design has only two custom parts (gyro wheel, mounting flange) with the rest begin off the shelf components (incl. made to measure shafts).](./figures/CMG-sidebyside.jpg){ #fig:cmg-plans }

![Hardware SPCMG prototype with robot attached to it. Gyros are in the aluminum cases with the gyro motors mounted on their sides. The gimbal motors hang underneath the gyros. The motor controller and power supply are mounted underneath the platform. The gyro controller, IMU and communication interface for these are mounted on top. Note that the rope suspension was rotated by 90Â° for the picture.](./figures/KR3_seitlich.jpg){ #fig:prototype-sideview }
