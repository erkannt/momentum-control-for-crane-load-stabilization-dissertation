  doi = {10.1109/ACC.2014.6859392},
  abstract = {There are two theoretical methods by which a two wheeled vehicle oriented in tandem can be stabilized: dynamic stabilization and control moment gyroscope (CMG) stabilization. Dynamic stabilization utilizes tactical steering techniques to trigger a lean in the vehicle in the intended direction for balancing, while CMG stabilization employs the reactive precession torque of a high speed flywheel about an axis that will act to balance the vehicle. Of these two, CMG stabilization offers greater advantages for static vehicles. This paper proposes a first order sliding mode controller (SMC) design to control the CMG and stabilize a bicycle at zero-forward velocity. This study also compares the SMC method to a PID controller to validate the advantages of the SMC controller for the highly non-linear system dynamics of static stabilization. The result of two experimental setups are presented and discussed. The first experimental platform is a single degree of freedom (DOF) inverted pendulum and the second is a three DOF bicycle.},

  doi = {10.1115/DETC2014-35539},
  abstract = {Our research examines the feasibility of usign a wearable scissored-pair control moment gyroscope (CMG) for human balance assist. The CMG is a momentum exchange device consisting of a fast spinning flywheel mounted on a gimbal. The gimbal motion changes the direction of the flywheel rotation axis, which generates a reactionless torque. A scissored-pair CMG has the additional advantage of isolating the output torque to a single axis, where off-axis torques are canceled out. A properly designed CMG device worn as a backpack can apply a torque in the sagittal plane of the human trunk. This can help in restoring postural balance and in fall mitigation.This paper describes the complete design process of a scissored-pair CMG device with constraints on size, mass and dynamic properties for human wearability. A prototype of this device is built, utilizing a novel dual-flywheel design; it weighs about 8kg and is able to generate over 20Nm of torque. A custom hardware is built specifically for verifying the torque output of the device. To our knowledge this is the only device that generates the range of reactionless torque given its weight and size.},

Our solution uses a control moment gyroscope to generate the compensation torque and an accelerometer for sensing. This approach makes the designed system completely independent from the stabilizing instrument, as well as independent from any external measurement. We compare two control approaches in a simulation: The first one uses a Kalman filter with a harmonic disturbance model, and the second one uses an adaptive algorithm. Results highlight the superiority of the adaptive control for our application. The first in vivo assessments are presented, showing the efficiency of the principle under real conditions. Using only accelerometric measurements, targeted cardiac motion harmonics are reduced on the order of 68\%. With an optical sensor, the reduction exceeds 90\%. This constitutes an improvement compared with prior solutions, despite the presence of nonnegligible uncertainties and distant sensing.},

As a result, the subject matter includes theory, technology, and systems engineering. The authors combine material on system-level architecture of spacecraft that feature momentum-control systems with material about the momentum-control hardware and software. This also encompasses material on the theoretical and algorithmic approaches to the control of space vehicles with CMGs. In essence, CMGs are the attitude-control actuators that make contemporary highly agile spacecraft possible. The rise of commercial Earth imaging, the advances in privately built spacecraft (including small satellites), and the growing popularity of the subject matter in academic circles over the past decade argues that now is the time for an in-depth treatment of the topic. CMGs are augmented by reaction wheels and related algorithms for steering all such actuators, which together comprise the field of spacecraft momentum control systems. The material is presented at a level suitable for practicing engineers and those with an undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, and/or aerospace engineering.},

Current robotic technology that assists human locomotion, however, aims at versatile functionality, particularly in the assistance of weak muscles.

In this paper, we investigate the use of minimalistic robotic technology that focuses exclusively on stabilizing human balance during gait. This task-specific device is novel in its combination of portability and simplicity.

  doi = {10.1016/j.autcon.2011.05.015},
  abstract = {The rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block can control the horizontal rotation angle of a steel beam being lifted by a tower crane using a mechanical apparatus. It is expected that the mechanized hook block can relieve safety concerns; however, at the same time, there are several concerns: Is precise control of the rotation angle possible? Won't it be slower than rotating a beam by hand? If a mechanized system is faster, how fast is it? In order to test these, experiments were conducted. The precision of the rotating angle and the time for rotating and stopping the rotation controllable hook block were measured using an orientation sensor and a laser point. The results were compared to those of the conventional manual method. Since a steel beam usually has a symmetrical shape, $\pi$/2rad (=90$^\circ$) is the maximum angle for placing a beam in the target location. The experiment results showed that a steel beam stopped after it moved 7$\pi$/600rad (=2.1$^\circ$) and 9$\pi$/200rad (=8.1$^\circ$) more, on average, due to inertia when the steel beam was rotated $\pi$/12rad (=15$^\circ$) and $\pi$/2rad (=90$^\circ$), respectively. However, it appeared that when an operator became used to the remote controller, the operator could reduce the rotation speed to stop a steel beam in the target location by reversing the motor direction. In terms of time, it took 5.80s, 8.69s, and 17.12s, on average, to rotate a steel beam $\pi$/12rad (=15$^\circ$), $\pi$/4rad (=45$^\circ$), and $\pi$/2rad (=90$^\circ$), respectively. The time for rotating steel beams using the conventional manual method at a construction site was also measured for comparison. The rotation time using the conventional manual method ranged from 11.96s to 91.00s depending on how easy it was for workers to reach and rotate a beam because workers rotate beams while hanging on a column. The results showed that the deviation could be reduced and work efficiency could be improved when a mechanized hook block is adopted on a construction site.},

The CMG subsystem consists of one motor for spinning the wheel, and the other motor for turning the outer gimbal. As an input of the system, applying force to the spin axis of the wheel leads the torque about the axis, whereas the wheel is spinning at high speed. This torque is used to control the attitude of the unstructured object in this study. For the stabilizer function, in addition, holding the load at the current position, the power applied to the gimbal motor of CMG will be cut, which results in a braking force to stop the load by the gyro effect. The CMG subsystem the authors developed consists of the mechanical system, a remote controller, a servo controller and control software for the system. The authors also present experimental results to show that the system they proposed is useful as construction machinery which can control the attitude of the beam hanging from a tower crane.},

Local and teleoperation experiments performed on a portable tower crane are used to verify the effectiveness of the method. Data from these experiments show that operators performed manipulation tasks faster and safer when input shaping was utilized to reduce payload sway. Furthermore, the teleoperation delays did not degrade the input shaping effectiveness.},

This paper evaluates an input-shaping control method for reducing double-pendulum oscillations. Human operator performance testing on a 10-ton industrial bridge crane is used to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the method. Fifty operators drove the crane with a standard control pendent, as well as a wireless touchscreen interface. Data from these experiments show that human operators drive the crane much faster and safer with the input-shaping control scheme. Furthermore, considerably less operator effort is required when input shaping is used to limit the oscillation. Additional tests required the operators to drive the crane numerous times over a period of eight days. These experiments show that significant learning occurred when operators did not have the aid of input shaping. However, the performance never approached that achieved by untrained operators using input shaping.},

The elegantly designed controller can simultaneously suppress the payload swing and regulate the trolley to the desired destination within a finite time for the 2D bridge crane system in the case of constant cable length. Considering cable length variation, the flatness-based tracking controller is presented meticulously in a separately two-step program. Specifically, the finite-time technique is first used to achieve the simultaneous motion regulation and payload swing suppression and elimination within a finite time. Then, we propose a Lyapunov-based tracking control method, under which the cable can track a predefined trajectory.

Currently, for double-pendulum cranes, most available methods are open-loop controllers designed based on linearized crane dynamics; even for existing closed-loop approaches, they are also mostly developed using linearized dynamics and require the exact knowledge of system parameters, which makes them sensitive to parametric uncertainties. To handle these issues, we present an adaptive antiswing control strategy for crane systems with double-pendulum swing effects and uncertain/unknown parameters, which can make the trolley accurately reach the target position with reduced overshoots and effectively eliminate the double-pendulum swing angles at the same time. A complete stability analysis, based upon the full nonlinear dynamics (i.e., without linearizing the dynamics), is included to support the theoretical derivations. We present hardware experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves better performance than existing ones and exhibits good robustness.},

The main goal of design is to use an appropriate control method that produces suitable external torques such that the whole system can be completely stabilized and controlled. For this purpose, mathematical model of the system is required which is achieved by Lagrange's equations in the first part of the paper. Since the controller design in this paper is based on state space description, these dynamical equations are re-written in the form of state-space equations and are linearized about an operating state. After examining the controllability of the system, a state feedback controller and also a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) are designed. Moreover, since in these controllers the states of the system are required, a suitable full-order state estimator is developed as well. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

An overhead crane transfers a work piece to a desired position while keeping the swing angle of the work piece small during this process. The rope should not have a swing angle at the load destination. In this paper, five controllers (i.e., linear and nonlinear controllers) are derived based on the passivity of the system. The total energy of the system and its square are used in a Lyapunov candidate function to design the controllers. The equilibrium point of the closed loop is proven asymptotically stable by the Lyapunov technique and LaSalle invariance theorem.

The target position of the closed-loop system is proven to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem. The proposed control law has a simple structure and is independent of system parameters. Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control method over a number of traditional controllers as well as its robustness against parameter uncertainties.

The literature of the field tends to be quite advanced indeed (see [1, 11]); one object of this paper is to show that computer programs, properly used, can make these advanced topics transparent.

This flexible system has six degrees of freedom, four variables describing the flexible, hanging load dynamics and two (directly controlled) input variables for the trolley position. The equations of motion are developed and the crane model is verified. Then a form of wave-based control (WBC) is applied to determine what trolley motion should be used to achieve a reference motion of the load, with minimum swing during complex manoeuvres. Despite the trolley's limited control authority over the complex, flexible 3-D dynamics, WBC enables the trolley to achieve very good motion control of the load, in a simple, robust and rapid way, using little sensor information, with all measurements taken at or close to the trolley.$<$/p$>$},
