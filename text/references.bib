Taking typical base reaction forces of industrial robots we show that control moment gyroscopes may provide means for compensation. From the basic principles of CMGs we derive design criteria for a free swinging robot platform. These criteria are illustrated in the design of a scissored pair CMG for a single DoF demonstrator.},

  doi = {10.1115/DETC2014-35539},
  abstract = {Our research examines the feasibility of usign a wearable scissored-pair control moment gyroscope (CMG) for human balance assist. The CMG is a momentum exchange device consisting of a fast spinning flywheel mounted on a gimbal. The gimbal motion changes the direction of the flywheel rotation axis, which generates a reactionless torque. A scissored-pair CMG has the additional advantage of isolating the output torque to a single axis, where off-axis torques are canceled out. A properly designed CMG device worn as a backpack can apply a torque in the sagittal plane of the human trunk. This can help in restoring postural balance and in fall mitigation.This paper describes the complete design process of a scissored-pair CMG device with constraints on size, mass and dynamic properties for human wearability. A prototype of this device is built, utilizing a novel dual-flywheel design; it weighs about 8kg and is able to generate over 20Nm of torque. A custom hardware is built specifically for verifying the torque output of the device. To our knowledge this is the only device that generates the range of reactionless torque given its weight and size.},

  abstract = {Falls are an urgent challenge in aging societies, and balance dysfunction is a major risk factor. Current robotic technology that assists human locomotion, however, aims at versatile functionality, particularly in the assistance of weak muscles. Such versatile design leads to heavy, bulky devices that are impractical in daily life for most elderly subjects. In this paper, we investigate the use of minimalistic robotic technology that focuses exclusively on stabilizing human balance during gait. This task-specific device is novel in its combination of portability and simplicity. Our initial simulations show that it is possible to return a person to a vertical position from an engagement angle of 10 degrees from vertical.},

  abstract = {The goal of this book is to serve both as a practical technical reference and a resource for gaining a fuller understanding of the state of the art of spacecraft momentum control systems, specifically looking at control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). As a result, the subject matter includes theory, technology, and systems engineering. The authors combine material on system-level architecture of spacecraft that feature momentum-control systems with material about the momentum-control hardware and software. This also encompasses material on the theoretical and algorithmic approaches to the control of space vehicles with CMGs. In essence, CMGs are the attitude-control actuators that make contemporary highly agile spacecraft possible. The rise of commercial Earth imaging, the advances in privately built spacecraft (including small satellites), and the growing popularity of the subject matter in academic circles over the past decade argues that now is the time for an in-depth treatment of the topic. CMGs are augmented by reaction wheels and related algorithms for steering all such actuators, which together comprise the field of spacecraft momentum control systems. The material is presented at a level suitable for practicing engineers and those with an undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, and/or aerospace engineering.},

Our solution uses a control moment gyroscope to generate the compensation torque and an accelerometer for sensing. This approach makes the designed system completely independent from the stabilizing instrument, as well as independent from any external measurement. We compare two control approaches in a simulation: The first one uses a Kalman filter with a harmonic disturbance model, and the second one uses an adaptive algorithm. Results highlight the superiority of the adaptive control for our application. The first in vivo assessments are presented, showing the efficiency of the principle under real conditions. Using only accelerometric measurements, targeted cardiac motion harmonics are reduced on the order of 68\%. With an optical sensor, the reduction exceeds 90\%. This constitutes an improvement compared with prior solutions, despite the presence of nonnegligible uncertainties and distant sensing.},
