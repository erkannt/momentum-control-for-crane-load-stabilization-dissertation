@article{AbdullahiAdaptiveOutputbasedCommand2018,
  abstract = {Payload hoisting and wind disturbance during crane operations are among the challenging factors that affect a payload sway and thus, affect the crane's performance. This paper proposes a new online adaptive output-based command shaping (AOCS) technique for an effective payload sway reduction of an overhead crane under the influence of those effects. This technique enhances the previously developed output-based command shaping (OCS) which was effective only for a fixed system and without external disturbances. Unlike the conventional input shaping design technique which requires the system's natural frequency and damping ratio, the proposed technique is designed by using the output signal and thus, an online adaptive algorithm can be formulated. To test the effectiveness of the AOCS, experiments are carried out using a laboratory overhead crane with a payload hoisting in the presence of wind, and with different payloads. The superiority of the method is confirmed by 82\% and 29\% reductions in the overall sway and the maximum transient sway respectively, when compared to the OCS, and two robust input shapers namely Zero Vibration Derivative-Derivative and Extra-Insensitive shapers. Furthermore, the method demonstrates a uniform crane's performance under all conditions. It is envisaged that the proposed method can be very useful in designing an effective controller for a crane system with an unknown payload and under the influence of external disturbances.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the control of a double mass and spring system as a physical model of a flexible arm robot is considered. The main goal of design is to use an appropriate control method that produces suitable external torques such that the whole system can be completely stabilized and controlled. For this purpose, mathematical model of the system is required which is achieved by Lagrange's equations in the first part of the paper. Since the controller design in this paper is based on state space description, these dynamical equations are re-written in the form of state-space equations and are linearized about an operating state. After examining the controllability of the system, a state feedback controller and also a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) are designed. Moreover, since in these controllers the states of the system are required, a suitable full-order state estimator is developed as well. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

The ROBOCRANE design utilizes the basic idea of the Stewart Platform parallel link manipulator. The unique feature of the NIST approach is to use cables as the parallel links and to use winches as the actuators. Depending on what is suspended from its work platform, the ROBOCRANE has land, air, water, and space applications. A 2-meter version and a 6-meter version of the ROBOCRANE have been built and critical performance characteristics analyzed. Through these and other conceptual models, example applications for ROBOCRANE are: flexible-structure mobility, heavy material handling, and flexible fixturing on land; rescue and personnel/ equipment maneuverability in air; subsea pipe-laying/removal, lifting, and salvage from stable or unstable references on water; and lightweight, long distance lunar rover capabilites in space. All applications of ROBOCRANE include a large work volume, six degree-of-freedom control, precision maneuverability, and enhanced crane capabilities. This paper describes ROBOCRANE's present and future performance measurements, control system designs, and the conceptual designs for a multitude of applications.},

They are evaluated for a dual-manipulator mobile robotic system with application to nuclear decommissioning. The first algorithm has similarities to other feedback control based solvers, and borrows ideas from the Cyclic Coordinate Decent and the Jacobian Transpose methods. This yields a particularly straightforward algorithm with tunable Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) gains to determine performance. The second approach utilises a discrete-time state space modelling framework to solve the IK problem. Although the second solver is more complex to implement, preliminary simulation results for the case study example, show that it can converge quicker, and has improved immunity to the kinematic singularities that can occur in Jacobian based methods.},

Translational and rotational motions cancel at the pivot when an impulsive blow is struck at the center of percussion.   The center of percussion is often discussed in the context of a bat, racquet, door, sword or other extended object held at one end. 
The same point is called the center of oscillation for the object suspended from the pivot as a pendulum, meaning that a simple pendulum with all its mass concentrated at that point will have the same period of oscillation as the compound pendulum.  In sports, the center of percussion of a bat or racquet is related to the so-called "sweet spot", but the latter is also related to vibrational bending of the object.},

  abstract = {Our research examines the feasibility of usign a wearable scissored-pair control moment gyroscope (CMG) for human balance assist. The CMG is a momentum exchange device consisting of a fast spinning flywheel mounted on a gimbal. The gimbal motion changes the direction of the flywheel rotation axis, which generates a reactionless torque. A scissored-pair CMG has the additional advantage of isolating the output torque to a single axis, where off-axis torques are canceled out. A properly designed CMG device worn as a backpack can apply a torque in the sagittal plane of the human trunk. This can help in restoring postural balance and in fall mitigation.This paper describes the complete design process of a scissored-pair CMG device with constraints on size, mass and dynamic properties for human wearability. A prototype of this device is built, utilizing a novel dual-flywheel design; it weighs about 8kg and is able to generate over 20Nm of torque. A custom hardware is built specifically for verifying the torque output of the device. To our knowledge this is the only device that generates the range of reactionless torque given its weight and size.},

Our solution uses a control moment gyroscope to generate the compensation torque and an accelerometer for sensing. This approach makes the designed system completely independent from the stabilizing instrument, as well as independent from any external measurement. We compare two control approaches in a simulation: The first one uses a Kalman filter with a harmonic disturbance model, and the second one uses an adaptive algorithm. Results highlight the superiority of the adaptive control for our application. The first in vivo assessments are presented, showing the efficiency of the principle under real conditions. Using only accelerometric measurements, targeted cardiac motion harmonics are reduced on the order of 68\%. With an optical sensor, the reduction exceeds 90\%. This constitutes an improvement compared with prior solutions, despite the presence of nonnegligible uncertainties and distant sensing.},

Momentum wheels mounted on three faces of the cube (Fig. 1) rotate at high angular velocities and then brake suddenly, causing the Cubli to jump up. Once the Cubli has almost reached the corner stand-up position, controlled motor torques are applied to make it balance on its corner.

Major opportunities exist to develop fullscale cranes and demonstrate construction of temporary bridges, causeways across wetlands, and overpasses for traffic management over repair sites. Remotely operated, mobile, lightweight cranes can put modular bridge sections in place and provide better control of loads. This could result in faster assembly and less environmental disturbance.

@article{HoangSimpleEnergybasedController2014,
  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple energy-based controller for a class of underactuated mechanical systems. The mechanical systems considered in this study are modeled with two degrees of freedom, driven by only one actuator, and easily excited to oscillate. The proposed controller is designed by exploiting the passivity of the system. The energy storage function is constructed such that the control input is passive, with a combined output of actuated and unactuated variables. The target position of the closed-loop system is proven to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance theorem. The proposed control law has a simple structure and is independent of system parameters. Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control method over a number of traditional controllers as well as its robustness against parameter uncertainties. These advantages point to the promising practical application of the proposed control method in control-underactuated systems, such as overhead cranes, single-link flexible-joint manipulators, and flexible Cartesian manipulators.},

While instability and control might at first glance appear contradictory, we can use the pendulum's instability to control it. Such results are vital in robotics: the forced pendulum is a basic subsystem of any robot. Most of the mathematical methods used in this paper were initially developed in celestial mechanics, largely by Poincar{\'e}. The literature of the field tends to be quite advanced indeed (see [1, 11]); one object of this paper is to show that computer programs, properly used, can make these advanced topics transparent. All the computer-generated pictures in this paper were produced by the programs Planar Systems and Planar Iterations [6], both written by Ben Hinkle (now at Maple). 1. Some parallels in celestial mechanics When I was a graduate student, I was amazed by the results of Alekseev concerning a system formed by three bodies obeying Newton's law of gravitation; see [1] and [11].

Task performance was compared between the bilateral mode and the unilateral mode with force telemetry data visually displayed on a screen.

This lowers the efficiency and the safety of this kind of work. For the purpose of reducing load rotation and dangerous works, a suspender device activated by a gyroscope has been developed This device controls load rotation via two different modes of the gyroscopic moment. In the active control mode, the load turns in high response to commands issued by the controller and can be correctly set in position at the desired angle. In the passive control mode, the load can be kept in position regardless of crane movement or outer disturbance. As a result of applying the suspender device to construction work, the cycle time for load transporting is effectively reduced and shortening of construction period is carried out. The operations are preciously regulated by wireless remote control, and dangerous manipulation works are drastically reduced This device generates no noise and guarantees a comfortable and safe construction environment.},

  abstract = {Gantry robots and anthropomorphic arms of various sizes have already been studied and, while they are in use in some parts of the world for automated construction, a new kind of wide workspace machinery, cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR), has emerged. These robots are capable of automated movement in a very wide workspace, using cables reeled in and out by winches as actuation members, the other elements being easily stacked for easy relocation and reconfiguration, which is critical for on-site construction. The motivation of this paper is to showcase the potential of a CDPR operating solely on motor position sensors and showing limited collisions from the cables for large-scale applications in the building industry relevant for additive manufacturing, without risk of collisions between the cables and the building. The combination of the Cogiro CDPR (Tecnalia, LIRMM-CNRS 2010) with the extruder and material of the Pylos project (IAAC 2013) opens the opportunity to a 3D printing machine with a workspace of 13.6 \texttimes{} 9.4 \texttimes{} 3.3 m. The design patterns for printing on such a large scale are disclosed, as well as the modifications that were necessary for both the Cogiro robot and Pylos extruder and material. Two prints, with different patterns, have been achieved with the Pylos extruder mounted on Cogiro: the first spanning 3.5 m in length, the second, reaching a height of 0.86 m. Based on this initial experiment, plans for building larger parts and buildings are discussed, as well as other possible applications for CDPRs in construction, such as the manipulation of assembly processes (windows, lintels, beams, floor elements, curtain wall modules, etc.) or brick laying.},

@article{JayakodyRobustAdaptiveCoordination2016,
  abstract = {Free-flying robotic spacecraft play a significant role in the space industry today. Unlike ground-based robots, the manipulator motion in a space robot can cause undesirable disturbances to the spacecraft platform, causing its attitude to change, potentially disrupting communication and solar energy collection processes as a result. Thus, coordinated control of both the spacecraft attitude and the manipulator motion become essential for successful space operations. Though past research has developed dynamic models for spacecraft manipulators, the contribution of reaction wheels to the angular momentum of the entire system needs further consideration. This paper reformulates the dynamic equations of a free-flying space robot by taking the aspect of reaction wheels into account. A diagonalization method is introduced to decouple the highly nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system model. A novel adaptive variable structure control method is then applied to implement a robust coordination controller for the space robot subjected to system uncertainties. Simulations are carried out on a spacecraft model with a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulator mounted on it to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. Comparisons with sliding mode control show that the new controller results in faster settling times, which leads to maintaining uninterrupted communication links and efficient solar energy harvesting.},

The platform is based on a fully mobile truck vehicle with a working reach diameter of over 80 feet. It can handle a 1,500 lb lift capacity and a 20 lb manipulation capacity. We report on the progress of the DCP and speculate on potential applications including fabrication of non-standard architectural forms, integration of real-time on-site sensing data, improvements in construction efficiency, enhanced resolution, lower error rates, and increased safety. We report on a case study for platform demonstration through large-scale 3D printing of insulative formwork for castable structures. We discuss benefits and potential future applications.},

@article{KimPerformanceStudiesHuman2010,
  abstract = {Oscillation of crane payloads makes it challenging to manipulate payloads quickly, accurately, and safely. The problem is compounded when the payload creates a double-pendulum effect. This paper evaluates an input-shaping control method for reducing double-pendulum oscillations. Human operator performance testing on a 10-ton industrial bridge crane is used to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the method. Fifty operators drove the crane with a standard control pendent, as well as a wireless touchscreen interface. Data from these experiments show that human operators drive the crane much faster and safer with the input-shaping control scheme. Furthermore, considerably less operator effort is required when input shaping is used to limit the oscillation. Additional tests required the operators to drive the crane numerous times over a period of eight days. These experiments show that significant learning occurred when operators did not have the aid of input shaping. However, the performance never approached that achieved by untrained operators using input shaping.},

@article{LeeAnalysisFieldApplicability2012,
  abstract = {The rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block can control the horizontal rotation angle of a steel beam being lifted by a tower crane using a mechanical apparatus. It is expected that the mechanized hook block can relieve safety concerns; however, at the same time, there are several concerns: Is precise control of the rotation angle possible? Won't it be slower than rotating a beam by hand? If a mechanized system is faster, how fast is it? In order to test these, experiments were conducted. The precision of the rotating angle and the time for rotating and stopping the rotation controllable hook block were measured using an orientation sensor and a laser point. The results were compared to those of the conventional manual method. Since a steel beam usually has a symmetrical shape, {$\pi$}/2rad (=90\textdegree{}) is the maximum angle for placing a beam in the target location. The experiment results showed that a steel beam stopped after it moved 7{$\pi$}/600rad (=2.1\textdegree{}) and 9{$\pi$}/200rad (=8.1\textdegree{}) more, on average, due to inertia when the steel beam was rotated {$\pi$}/12rad (=15\textdegree{}) and {$\pi$}/2rad (=90\textdegree{}), respectively. However, it appeared that when an operator became used to the remote controller, the operator could reduce the rotation speed to stop a steel beam in the target location by reversing the motor direction. In terms of time, it took 5.80s, 8.69s, and 17.12s, on average, to rotate a steel beam {$\pi$}/12rad (=15\textdegree{}), {$\pi$}/4rad (=45\textdegree{}), and {$\pi$}/2rad (=90\textdegree{}), respectively. The time for rotating steel beams using the conventional manual method at a construction site was also measured for comparison. The rotation time using the conventional manual method ranged from 11.96s to 91.00s depending on how easy it was for workers to reach and rotate a beam because workers rotate beams while hanging on a column. The results showed that the deviation could be reduced and work efficiency could be improved when a mechanized hook block is adopted on a construction site.},

Two tracking areas and one positioning block in each frame are used to search image features and determine the useful vision information. The depth information of 3-D crane system in images can be also obtained by a tag on the dynamic plant. The presented visual tracking method involves comparison of the lightest or darkest points in the tracking or positioning area of a dynamic object and then computes the necessary trolley position and load swing in 3-D space. Upon tracking, the sensing data are sent to an adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode controller (AFSMC) to derive control power for the crane system. Accordingly, the merits of this AFSMC approach, including robustness of the sliding-mode control and the model-free property of the fuzzy logic for the 3-D crane system, are confirmed. Experimental results verify the improvement of the proposed methodology.},

As a result, the subject matter includes theory, technology, and systems engineering. The authors combine material on system-level architecture of spacecraft that feature momentum-control systems with material about the momentum-control hardware and software. This also encompasses material on the theoretical and algorithmic approaches to the control of space vehicles with CMGs. In essence, CMGs are the attitude-control actuators that make contemporary highly agile spacecraft possible. The rise of commercial Earth imaging, the advances in privately built spacecraft (including small satellites), and the growing popularity of the subject matter in academic circles over the past decade argues that now is the time for an in-depth treatment of the topic. CMGs are augmented by reaction wheels and related algorithms for steering all such actuators, which together comprise the field of spacecraft momentum control systems. The material is presented at a level suitable for practicing engineers and those with an undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, and/or aerospace engineering.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The overhead trolley of a gantry crane can be moved in two directions in the plane. The trolley is attempting to control the motion of a suspended, rigid-body, distributed mass load, supported by a hook, modelled as a lumped mass, in turn connected to the trolley by a light flexible cable. This flexible system has six degrees of freedom, four variables describing the flexible, hanging load dynamics and two (directly controlled) input variables for the trolley position. The equations of motion are developed and the crane model is verified. Then a form of wave-based control (WBC) is applied to determine what trolley motion should be used to achieve a reference motion of the load, with minimum swing during complex manoeuvres. Despite the trolley's limited control authority over the complex, flexible 3-D dynamics, WBC enables the trolley to achieve very good motion control of the load, in a simple, robust and rapid way, using little sensor information, with all measurements taken at or close to the trolley.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

@article{OzgorenComparativeStudyAttitude2019,
  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study about the attitude control methods based on four commonly used error indicators, namely the triad of 3-2-1 deviational Euler angles, the error quaternion, the deviational angle\textendash{}axis pair and the orientation error matrix. These error indicators are used here with the same backstepping control law to have a common basis of comparison. This control law makes the controller track a restoring angular velocity generated here specifically for each error indicator. This comparative study shows that all these error indicators can be used satisfactorily even in the critical orientations associated with them by taking special measures. For the deviational Euler angle triad, a critical orientation is a singularity, at which the angles become indefinite. Unless the vehicle is stationary, this indefiniteness is resolved here by applying L'Hopital's Rule on the angular velocity information. The Euler angle triad has also a multiplicity problem. It is solved here by using the novel criterion of minimal deviation angles. For the other error indicators, a critical orientation is an antipodal orientation, which is opposite to the desired one. In an antipodal orientation, the error quaternion and the deviational angle\textendash{}axis pair cannot be determined through the customary formulas. They are determined here by using the novel specially introduced formulas. Besides, they may suffer from the unwinding phenomenon in an ordinary orientation. This phenomenon is prevented here by keeping the scalar part of the error quaternion non-negative and the deviation angle between 0\textdegree{} and 180\textdegree. For the orientation error matrix, a stationary and undisturbed antipodal orientation is an unstable equilibrium, in which the ordinary backstepping control law becomes ineffective for driving the system into action. This problem is solved here by adding an extra term to the ordinary backstepping control law.},

  abstract = {The load of overhead cranes are attached to the mechanical structure with a rope, consequently the trajectory of the load cannot be actuated directly. This results in an unwanted oscillatory behaviour, which needs to be damped for the effective and safe transportation. In existing automated cranes, control solutions suggest state-feedback law. In previous work we proposed an estimation algorithm employing the unscented Kalman filter for the calculation of the unmeasured states. Because of the stiction, this method becomes inaccurate when the trolley does not move. In this paper we suggest the application of a pair of laser slot sensors for detecting when the rope is close to the vertical. Incremental encoders are used to measure the displacement of the trolley and the length of the rope. Since the detection of the vertical rope angle is asynchronous w.r.t. the sampling instant, an appropriate sensor fusion technique is provided. The effectiveness of the estimation method is verified on a real laboratory crane setup.},

  abstract = {SummarySpace robotics will become a key technology for the exploration of outer space and the operation and maintenance of space stations, satellites and other platforms, saving costs and relieving man from dangerous tasks. But we do not have to wait until robots are really autonomous or intelligent, since by modern teleoperation and telepresence we are able to remotely control robot systems from the ground in the sense of ``prolonging man's arm into space''. Humans, with their several hundred thousand years of evolution, will not adapt themselves to the hostile space environment, whilst robots, which have only been developed for just over 40 years, can be much more easily adapted to such an environment. As presented within this work, few pioneering telerobotic experiments like ROTEX, the first remotely controlled space robot system, ETS-VII, the first free-floating space robot experiment, or ROKVISS, Germany's recent advanced space robot experiment on the International Space Station, have been proposed and conducted on the way towards a space robot assistant system for the usage as an artificial astronaut to perform On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) tasks.},

The CMG subsystem consists of one motor for spinning the wheel, and the other motor for turning the outer gimbal. As an input of the system, applying force to the spin axis of the wheel leads the torque about the axis, whereas the wheel is spinning at high speed. This torque is used to control the attitude of the unstructured object in this study. For the stabilizer function, in addition, holding the load at the current position, the power applied to the gimbal motor of CMG will be cut, which results in a braking force to stop the load by the gyro effect. The CMG subsystem the authors developed consists of the mechanical system, a remote controller, a servo controller and control software for the system. The authors also present experimental results to show that the system they proposed is useful as construction machinery which can control the attitude of the beam hanging from a tower crane.},

The paper presents a comprehensive dynamic model for a reaction wheel actuated spacecraft and a robust controller that can maintain the attitude of the spacecraft as required while the manipulator follows the desired trajectory. Unlike previous work, this paper reformulates the dynamic equation of a Free-Flying Space Robot (FFSR) with actuating Reaction Wheels (RWs) by taking into account the contribution of RWs to the angular momentum of the entire system. Given strong nonlinearities and multiple inputs of the system, diagonalization is first used to transform the strongly coupled problem into multiple single-input problems by introducing virtual torques. When involving system uncertainties, the defined virtual torque is accurately associated with the actual torque using nominal value of the uncertain inertia matrix in order to guarantee stability of original system. Smoothed Sliding Mode (SMC) controllers are designed for each single-input system provided that the bounds of uncertainties can be estimated. A spacecraft mounted with a 3-DOF manipulator is used in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of the control law when applied to space manipulators.},

@article{SpryGyroscopicStabilisationUnstable2008,
  abstract = {We consider active gyroscopic stabilisation of unstable bodies such as two-wheeled monorails, two-wheeled cars, or unmanned bicycles. It has been speculated that gyroscopically stabilised monorail cars would have economic advantages with respect to birail cars, enabling the cars to take sharper curves and traverse steeper terrain, with lower installation and maintenance costs. A two-wheeled, gyro-stabilised car was actually constructed in 1913. The dynamic stabilisation of a monorail car or two-wheeled automobile requires that a torque acting on the car from the outside be neutralised by a torque produced within the car by a gyroscope. The gyroscope here is used as an actuator, not a sensor, by using precession forces generated by the gyroscope. When torque is applied to an axis normal to the spin axis, causing the gyroscope to precess, a moment is produced about a third axis, orthogonal to both the torque and spin axes. As the vehicle tilts from vertical, a precession-inducing torque is applied to the gyroscope cage such that the resulting gyroscopic reaction moment will tend to right the vehicle. The key idea is that motion of the gyroscope relative to the body is actively controlled in order to generate a stabilising moment. This problem was considered in 1905 by Louis Brennan (1905, see ref. 1). Many extensions were later developed, including the work by Shilovskii (1924, see ref. 2), and several prototypes were built. The differences in the various schemes lie in the number of gyroscopes employed, the direction of the spin axes relative to the rail, and in the method used to produce precession of the spin axes. We start by deriving the equations of motion for a case where the system is formed of a vehicle, a load placed on the vehicle, the gyroscope wheel, and a gyroscope cage. We allow for track curvature and vehicle speed. We then derive the equations for a similar system with two gyroscopes, spinning in opposite directions and such that the precession angles are opposite. We linearise the dynamics about a set of equilibrium points and develop a linearised model. We study the stability of the linearised systems and show simulation results. Finally, we discuss a scaled gyrovehicle model and testing.},

  abstract = {In practical applications, industrial cranes may exhibit double-pendulum swing effects, due to many factors, such as large payload scales and non-negligible hook masses. Currently, for double-pendulum cranes, most available methods are open-loop controllers designed based on linearized crane dynamics; even for existing closed-loop approaches, they are also mostly developed using linearized dynamics and require the exact knowledge of system parameters, which makes them sensitive to parametric uncertainties. To handle these issues, we present an adaptive antiswing control strategy for crane systems with double-pendulum swing effects and uncertain/unknown parameters, which can make the trolley accurately reach the target position with reduced overshoots and effectively eliminate the double-pendulum swing angles at the same time. A complete stability analysis, based upon the full nonlinear dynamics (i.e., without linearizing the dynamics), is included to support the theoretical derivations. We present hardware experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves better performance than existing ones and exhibits good robustness.},

However, such robots with big workspaces are affected either by cable sagging or by a very low end-effector stiffness, both causing positioning errors. With lightweight cables, the very low stiffness yields disturbing vibrations. In this paper, we address the problem of decoupled active canceling of those vibrations in the modal space. In modal space, vibrations are decomposed in orthogonal signals which allows to use simple SISO control methods to build an active vibration canceling algorithm for the end-effector. As the modal space depends on the end-effector position, better performances are achieved if the controller is tuned for the current robot position. The proposed method is tested both on a realistic simulation and on a 8-cables and 6-degrees of freedom robot.},

An overhead crane transfers a work piece to a desired position while keeping the swing angle of the work piece small during this process. The rope should not have a swing angle at the load destination. In this paper, five controllers (i.e., linear and nonlinear controllers) are derived based on the passivity of the system. The total energy of the system and its square are used in a Lyapunov candidate function to design the controllers. The equilibrium point of the closed loop is proven asymptotically stable by the Lyapunov technique and LaSalle invariance theorem. The optimal linear controller is combined to force the swing angle to converge rapidly to zero by reaching the trolley location. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted by using the test bed model to evaluate the controllers.},

Moving in-space, as opposed to in-plane, poses new control problems which, for the most part, are still open. In this paper, a hybrid approach where an energy-shaping, passivity-based swing-up controller hands off the control to a linear-quadratic-regulator in the vicinity of the unstable upright equilibrium is proposed. A direct approach and a pre-compensated approach are described, discussed, and illustrated by means of examples in simulation.},

@article{XuOnorbitIdentifyingInertia2017,
  abstract = {After being launched into space to perform some tasks, the inertia parameters of a space robotic system may change due to fuel consumption, hardware reconfiguration, target capturing, and so on. For precision control and simulation, it is required to identify these parameters on orbit. This paper proposes an effective method for identifying the complete inertia parameters (including the mass, inertia tensor and center of mass position) of a space robotic system. The key to the method is to identify two types of simple dynamics systems: equivalent single-body and two-body systems. For the former, all of the joints are locked into a designed configuration and the thrusters are used for orbital maneuvering. The object function for optimization is defined in terms of acceleration and velocity of the equivalent single body. For the latter, only one joint is unlocked and driven to move along a planned (exiting) trajectory in free-floating mode. The object function is defined based on the linear and angular momentum equations. Then, the parameter identification problems are transformed into non-linear optimization problems. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to determine the optimal parameters, i.e. the complete dynamic parameters of the two equivalent systems. By sequentially unlocking the 1st to nth joints (or unlocking the nth to 1st joints), the mass properties of body 0 to n (or n to 0) are completely identified. For the proposed method, only simple dynamics equations are needed for identification. The excitation motion (orbit maneuvering and joint motion) is also easily realized. Moreover, the method does not require prior knowledge of the mass properties of any body. It is general and practical for identifying a space robotic system on-orbit.},

@article{YangDynamicModellingAdaptive2018,
  abstract = {In this paper, both the closed-form dynamics and adaptive robust tracking control of a space robot with two-link flexible manipulators under unknown disturbances are developed. The dynamic model of the system is described with assumed modes approach and Lagrangian method. The flexible manipulators are represented as Euler\textendash{}Bernoulli beams. Based on singular perturbation technique, the displacements/joint angles and flexible modes are modelled as slow and fast variables, respectively. A sliding mode control is designed for trajectories tracking of the slow subsystem under unknown but bounded disturbances, and an adaptive sliding mode control is derived for slow subsystem under unknown slowly time-varying disturbances. An optimal linear quadratic regulator method is proposed for the fast subsystem to damp out the vibrations of the flexible manipulators. Theoretical analysis validates the stability of the proposed composite controller. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the performance of the closed-loop flexible space robot system.},

@inproceedings{YetkinGyroscopicStabilizationUnmanned2014,
  abstract = {There are two theoretical methods by which a two wheeled vehicle oriented in tandem can be stabilized: dynamic stabilization and control moment gyroscope (CMG) stabilization. Dynamic stabilization utilizes tactical steering techniques to trigger a lean in the vehicle in the intended direction for balancing, while CMG stabilization employs the reactive precession torque of a high speed flywheel about an axis that will act to balance the vehicle. Of these two, CMG stabilization offers greater advantages for static vehicles. This paper proposes a first order sliding mode controller (SMC) design to control the CMG and stabilize a bicycle at zero-forward velocity. This study also compares the SMC method to a PID controller to validate the advantages of the SMC controller for the highly non-linear system dynamics of static stabilization. The result of two experimental setups are presented and discussed. The first experimental platform is a single degree of freedom (DOF) inverted pendulum and the second is a three DOF bicycle.},

@article{YiAttitudeControlStabilization2000,
  abstract = {An Attitude Control and Stabilization of an Unstructured Object using CMG Subsystem CMG;Gyro actuator;gyro effect;piezoelectric vibrating gyroscope sensor;PID control; In this paper, we propose an attitude controller for an unstructured object using CMG(Control Moment of Gyro) subsystem, which has a stabilizer function. The CMG subsystem consists of one motor for spinning the wheel and the other motor for turning the outer gimbal. While the wheel of CMG subsystem is spinning at high speed, applying force to the spin axis of the wheel leads the torque about the vertical axis. We utilize the torque to control the attitude of object in this study. For the stabilizer function, in additiion, holding the load at the current position, the power applied to the gimbal motor of CMG will be cut, which result in the braking force to stop the load by gyro effect. However, due to the gear reduction connected to outer gimbal, slow load motion cannot generate the braking force. Thus, in this study, we are willing to make a holding force by applying control power to the gimbal motor from the signal of piezoelectric gyroscopic sensor that detected the angular velocity of the load. These two features are demonstrated in experiment, carrying a beam with crane. As a result, load was started to rotate by controlling gimbal positiion and was stopped by turning off the gimbal power. Moreover, slow movement of the load was also rejected by additional control with gyroscopic sensor.},

@inproceedings{YiImplementationGyroActuator1999,
  abstract = {It is well known that the attitude control of an object hanging with wire is not easy by using usual actuators. Even though an actuator such as a fan can be used for controlling the object it is difficult to meet the desired control objective. For these reasons, we propose a gyro actuator constructed with two motors. The first motor is responsible for spinning the wheel at high speed and the second motor is used to turn the outer gimbal. By applying the torque to the second motor, which results in the turn of the outer gimbal, the torque about the vertical axis can be obtained while the wheel of the gyro is spinning constantly. This torque is used to control the attitude of the object attached. The aim of this paper is to derive the transfer function of the actuator and show the usefulness. Experiments to the prototype model using a state feedback control and PID control are conducted to show the usefulness of the proposed gyro actuator.},

The differential-flatness-based approach is applied to the development of finite-time control laws. The elegantly designed controller can simultaneously suppress the payload swing and regulate the trolley to the desired destination within a finite time for the 2D bridge crane system in the case of constant cable length. Considering cable length variation, the flatness-based tracking controller is presented meticulously in a separately two-step program. Specifically, the finite-time technique is first used to achieve the simultaneous motion regulation and payload swing suppression and elimination within a finite time. Then, we propose a Lyapunov-based tracking control method, under which the cable can track a predefined trajectory. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate both the efficiency and the robustness against external disturbances of the addressed control algorithms.},
