  abstract: >-
    Payload hoisting and wind disturbance during crane operations are among the
    challenging factors that affect a payload sway and thus, affect the crane’s
    performance. This paper proposes a new online adaptive output-based command
    shaping (AOCS) technique for an effective payload sway reduction of an
    overhead crane under the influence of those effects. This technique enhances
    the previously developed output-based command shaping (OCS) which was
    effective only for a fixed system and without external disturbances. Unlike
    the conventional input shaping design technique which requires the system’s
    natural frequency and damping ratio, the proposed technique is designed by
    using the output signal and thus, an online adaptive algorithm can be
    formulated. To test the effectiveness of the AOCS, experiments are carried
    out using a laboratory overhead crane with a payload hoisting in the
    presence of wind, and with different payloads. The superiority of the method
    is confirmed by 82% and 29% reductions in the overall sway and the maximum
    transient sway respectively, when compared to the OCS, and two robust input
    shapers namely Zero Vibration Derivative-Derivative and Extra-Insensitive
    shapers. Furthermore, the method demonstrates a uniform crane’s performance
    under all conditions. It is envisaged that the proposed method can be very
    useful in designing an effective controller for a crane system with an
    unknown payload and under the influence of external disturbances.

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, the control of a double mass and spring system as a physical
    model of a flexible arm robot is considered. The main goal of design is to
    use an appropriate control method that produces suitable external torques
    such that the whole system can be completely stabilized and controlled. For
    this purpose, mathematical model of the system is required which is achieved
    by Lagrange's equations in the first part of the paper. Since the controller
    design in this paper is based on state space description, these dynamical
    equations are re-written in the form of state-space equations and are
    linearized about an operating state. After examining the controllability of
    the system, a state feedback controller and also a Linear Quadratic
    Regulator (LQR) are designed. Moreover, since in these controllers the
    states of the system are required, a suitable full-order state estimator is
    developed as well. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the
    effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

    This paper presents the building of lightweight tensile structures with
    quadrocopters. The construction elements (such as ropes, cables, and wires)
    in this kind of structure are subject to tension forces. This paper
    identifies the basic building elements (nodes, links) required for the
    construction of tensile structures, and translates them into meaningful
    trajectories for quadrocopters. The use of a library of building elements is
    suggested. Hybrid force-position control strategies based on admittance
    control are exploited. Prototypical tensile structures are built by
    quadrocopters to validate the proposed approach. An accompanying video shows
    the building process.

  abstract: >-
    The Robot Systems Division of the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) has recently been experimenting with a variety of
    applications for the NIST ROBOCRANE. The ROBOCRANE design utilizes the basic
    idea of the Stewart Platform parallel link manipulator. The unique feature
    of the NIST approach is to use cables as the parallel links and to use
    winches as the actuators. Depending on what is suspended from its work
    platform, the ROBOCRANE has land, air, water, and space applications. A
    2-meter version and a 6-meter version of the ROBOCRANE have been built and
    critical performance characteristics analyzed. Through these and other
    conceptual models, example applications for ROBOCRANE are:
    flexible-structure mobility, heavy material handling, and flexible fixturing
    on land; rescue and personnel/ equipment maneuverability in air; subsea
    pipe-laying/removal, lifting, and salvage from stable or unstable references
    on water; and lightweight, long distance lunar rover capabilites in space.
    All applications of ROBOCRANE include a large work volume, six
    degree-of-freedom control, precision maneuverability, and enhanced crane
    capabilities. This paper describes ROBOCRANE's present and future
    performance measurements, control system designs, and the conceptual designs
    for a multitude of applications.

    The article develops two novel feedback control-based Inverse Kinematics
    (IK) solvers. They are evaluated for a dual-manipulator mobile robotic
    system with application to nuclear decommissioning. The first algorithm has
    similarities to other feedback control based solvers, and borrows ideas from
    the Cyclic Coordinate Decent and the Jacobian Transpose methods. This yields
    a particularly straightforward algorithm with tunable
    Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) gains to determine performance. The
    second approach utilises a discrete-time state space modelling framework to
    solve the IK problem. Although the second solver is more complex to
    implement, preliminary simulation results for the case study example, show
    that it can converge quicker, and has improved immunity to the kinematic
    singularities that can occur in Jacobian based methods.

    The center of percussion is the point on an extended massive object attached
    to a pivot where a perpendicular impact will produce no reactive shock at
    the pivot.   Translational and rotational motions cancel at the pivot when
    an impulsive blow is struck at the center of percussion.   The center of
    percussion is often discussed in the context of a bat, racquet, door, sword
    or other extended object held at one end. 

    The same point is called the center of oscillation for the object suspended
    from the pivot as a pendulum, meaning that a simple pendulum with all its
    mass concentrated at that point will have the same period of oscillation as
    the compound pendulum.  In sports, the center of percussion of a bat or
    racquet is related to the so-called "sweet spot", but the latter is also
    related to vibrational bending of the object.

    Our research examines the feasibility of usign a wearable scissored-pair
    control moment gyroscope (CMG) for human balance assist. The CMG is a
    momentum exchange device consisting of a fast spinning flywheel mounted on a
    gimbal. The gimbal motion changes the direction of the flywheel rotation
    axis, which generates a reactionless torque. A scissored-pair CMG has the
    additional advantage of isolating the output torque to a single axis, where
    off-axis torques are canceled out. A properly designed CMG device worn as a
    backpack can apply a torque in the sagittal plane of the human trunk. This
    can help in restoring postural balance and in fall mitigation.This paper
    describes the complete design process of a scissored-pair CMG device with
    constraints on size, mass and dynamic properties for human wearability. A
    prototype of this device is built, utilizing a novel dual-flywheel design;
    it weighs about 8kg and is able to generate over 20Nm of torque. A custom
    hardware is built specifically for verifying the torque output of the
    device. To our knowledge this is the only device that generates the range of
    reactionless torque given its weight and size.

    The Euler methods on Lie group are developed for the differential–algebraic
    equations of multibody system dynamics with holonomic constraints. The
    implicit Euler method is used to solve the differential–algebraic equations
    as Euler–Lagrange equations on Lie group with indices 1, 2, and 3 and the
    case of overdetermined differential–algebraic equations mixing with
    configuration space. The symplectic Euler method is used to solve the
    differential–algebraic equations as constrained Hamilton equations on Lie
    group. For the discrete mapping between Lie group and Lie algebra, the
    canonical coordinates of the second kind for implicit first-order
    Crouch–Grossman Euler methods of differential–algebraic equations are used.
    A single pendulum and a double pendulum in the space are used to verify the
    accuracy of the Lie group Euler methods.

  abstract: >-
    The difficulties encountered in preventing the cardiac motion is a hindrance
    to the development of recent less invasive techniques in the field of
    beating heart surgery. Some solutions were developed already in order to
    solve this problem, inducing specific and cumbersome equipment. The
    alternative described herein is based on a compact simple device using
    gyroscopic effect, intended to be adaptable to existing equipment and which
    is non-grounded. The presented work is a preliminary study of such a system.
    After exposing the principle and dynamical equations we present the device
    design process which was carried out and finally discuss the control
    strategy based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis and its
    simulation results.

    We present herein an original solution to actively stabilize the epicardium
    in the context of beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting. Our
    solution uses a control moment gyroscope to generate the compensation torque
    and an accelerometer for sensing. This approach makes the designed system
    completely independent from the stabilizing instrument, as well as
    independent from any external measurement. We compare two control approaches
    in a simulation: The first one uses a Kalman filter with a harmonic
    disturbance model, and the second one uses an adaptive algorithm. Results
    highlight the superiority of the adaptive control for our application. The
    first in vivo assessments are presented, showing the efficiency of the
    principle under real conditions. Using only accelerometric measurements,
    targeted cardiac motion harmonics are reduced on the order of 68%. With an
    optical sensor, the reduction exceeds 90%. This constitutes an improvement
    compared with prior solutions, despite the presence of nonnegligible
    uncertainties and distant sensing.

    This paper introduces the Cubli, a 15×15×15 cm cube that can jump up and
    balance on a corner. Momentum wheels mounted on three faces of the cube
    (Fig. 1) rotate at high angular velocities and then brake suddenly, causing
    the Cubli to jump up. Once the Cubli has almost reached the corner stand-up
    position, controlled motor torques are applied to make it balance on its
    corner. This paper tracks the development of the Cubli's one dimensional
    prototype at ETH Zurich and presents preliminary results.

    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed
    conceptual designs, laboratory scale models, and computer
    simulations/animation of several configurations of remotely operated cranes
    to assemble highway bridges. NIST’s designs have been patented and
    trademarked as “RoboCrane.” Major opportunities exist to develop fullscale
    cranes and demonstrate construction of temporary bridges, causeways across
    wetlands, and overpasses for traffic management over repair sites. Remotely
    operated, mobile, lightweight cranes can put modular bridge sections in
    place and provide better control of loads. This could result in faster
    assembly and less environmental disturbance. RoboCrane configurations that
    are well suited for bridge assembly and their potential savings in time and
    cost are discussed.

    Aiming at the anti-collision monitoring of tower crane, the models of state
    equation and observation equation for obstacle are established, and distance
    measurement method based on ultrasonic sensor for tower crane obstacle is
    proposed. According to the multi-sensor information fusion theory and
    obstacle kinematic model, Kalman filter principle is used to respectively
    deal with single ultrasonic sensor information and multi-ultrasonic sensor
    information fusion, then those simulation and experiments results are
    analyzed and contrasted. The results show that multi-sensor distance
    measurement is more accurate and stable than single sensor distance
    measurement, and verify the feasibility and superiority of multi-sensor
    information fusion theory in tower crane anti-collision applications.

    In this paper we illustrate the feasibility of using control moment
    gyroscopes (CMGs) for the stabilization of free swinging robots hanging from
    single tendons. Such systems may provide robotic workspaces of unprecedented
    size, especially in the vertical. Taking typical base reaction forces of
    industrial robots we show that control moment gyroscopes may provide means
    for compensation. From the basic principles of CMGs we derive design
    criteria for a free swinging robot platform. These criteria are illustrated
    in the design of a scissored pair CMG for a single DoF demonstrator.

    In April 1993 for the first time in the history of space flight, a small
    multisensory robot performed a number of prototype tasks on-board a
    spacecraft (spacelab D2 on shuttle COLUMBIA) in different operational modes
    that are feasible today, namely preprogrammed remotely controlled operations
    by the astronauts using a control ball and a stereo TV-monitor, as well as
    remotely controlled from ground via the human operator and machine
    intelligence. In these operational modes the robot successfully closed and
    opened connector plugs (bayonet closure), assembled structures from single
    parts and captured a free-floating object. Several key technologies have
    made this space robot technology experiment ROTEX a big success:
    multisensory gripper technology, local (shared autonomy) sensory feedback
    control concepts, and the powerful delay-compensating 3D-graphics simulation
    (predictive simulation) in the telerobotic ground station. This paper
    focusses on the tele-sensor-programming approach and the predictive
    simulation used for remote ground control.<>

  abstract: >-
    This paper proposes a simple energy-based controller for a class of
    underactuated mechanical systems. The mechanical systems considered in this
    study are modeled with two degrees of freedom, driven by only one actuator,
    and easily excited to oscillate. The proposed controller is designed by
    exploiting the passivity of the system. The energy storage function is
    constructed such that the control input is passive, with a combined output
    of actuated and unactuated variables. The target position of the closed-loop
    system is proven to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov techniques and
    LaSalle’s invariance theorem. The proposed control law has a simple
    structure and is independent of system parameters. Numerical simulations and
    experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control
    method over a number of traditional controllers as well as its robustness
    against parameter uncertainties. These advantages point to the promising
    practical application of the proposed control method in
    control-underactuated systems, such as overhead cranes, single-link
    flexible-joint manipulators, and flexible Cartesian manipulators.

  abstract: >-
    We show that a “simple ” differential equation modeling a garden-variety
    damped forced pendulum can exhibit extraordinarily complicated and unstable
    behavior. While instability and control might at first glance appear
    contradictory, we can use the pendulum’s instability to control it. Such
    results are vital in robotics: the forced pendulum is a basic subsystem of
    any robot. Most of the mathematical methods used in this paper were
    initially developed in celestial mechanics, largely by Poincaré. The
    literature of the field tends to be quite advanced indeed (see [1, 11]); one
    object of this paper is to show that computer programs, properly used, can
    make these advanced topics transparent. All the computer-generated pictures
    in this paper were produced by the programs Planar Systems and Planar
    Iterations [6], both written by Ben Hinkle (now at Maple). 1. Some parallels
    in celestial mechanics When I was a graduate student, I was amazed by the
    results of Alekseev concerning a system formed by three bodies obeying
    Newton’s law of gravitation; see [1] and [11]. As shown in Figure 1, two
    massive bodies of equal mass move in a plane P on ellipses

    A bilateral teleoperation experiment with Engineering Test Satellite 7
    (ETS-VII) was conducted on November 22, 1999. Round-trip time for
    communication between the National Space Development Agency of Japan ground
    station and the ETS-VII was approximately seven seconds. We constructed a
    bilateral teleoperator that is stable, even under such a long time delay.
    Several experiments, such as slope-tracing task and peg-in-hole task, were
    carried out. Task performance was compared between the bilateral mode and
    the unilateral mode with force telemetry data visually displayed on a
    screen. All tasks were possible by bilateral control without any visual
    information. Experimental results showed that kinesthetic force feedback to
    the operator is helpful even under such a long time delay, and improves the
    performance of the task.

  abstract: >-
    In the transportation of construction material using tower cranes, the
    hanging loads are frequently rotated by external disturbances. This lowers
    the efficiency and the safety of this kind of work. For the purpose of
    reducing load rotation and dangerous works, a suspender device activated by
    a gyroscope has been developed This device controls load rotation via two
    different modes of the gyroscopic moment. In the active control mode, the
    load turns in high response to commands issued by the controller and can be
    correctly set in position at the desired angle. In the passive control mode,
    the load can be kept in position regardless of crane movement or outer
    disturbance. As a result of applying the suspender device to construction
    work, the cycle time for load transporting is effectively reduced and
    shortening of construction period is carried out. The operations are
    preciously regulated by wireless remote control, and dangerous manipulation
    works are drastically reduced This device generates no noise and guarantees
    a comfortable and safe construction environment.

  abstract: >-
    Gantry robots and anthropomorphic arms of various sizes have already been
    studied and, while they are in use in some parts of the world for automated
    construction, a new kind of wide workspace machinery, cable-driven parallel
    robots (CDPR), has emerged. These robots are capable of automated movement
    in a very wide workspace, using cables reeled in and out by winches as
    actuation members, the other elements being easily stacked for easy
    relocation and reconfiguration, which is critical for on-site construction.
    The motivation of this paper is to showcase the potential of a CDPR
    operating solely on motor position sensors and showing limited collisions
    from the cables for large-scale applications in the building industry
    relevant for additive manufacturing, without risk of collisions between the
    cables and the building. The combination of the Cogiro CDPR (Tecnalia,
    LIRMM-CNRS 2010) with the extruder and material of the Pylos project (IAAC
    2013) opens the opportunity to a 3D printing machine with a workspace of
    13.6 × 9.4 × 3.3 m. The design patterns for printing on such a large scale
    are disclosed, as well as the modifications that were necessary for both the
    Cogiro robot and Pylos extruder and material. Two prints, with different
    patterns, have been achieved with the Pylos extruder mounted on Cogiro: the
    first spanning 3.5 m in length, the second, reaching a height of 0.86 m.
    Based on this initial experiment, plans for building larger parts and
    buildings are discussed, as well as other possible applications for CDPRs in
    construction, such as the manipulation of assembly processes (windows,
    lintels, beams, floor elements, curtain wall modules, etc.) or brick laying.

  abstract: >-
    Free-flying robotic spacecraft play a significant role in the space industry
    today. Unlike ground-based robots, the manipulator motion in a space robot
    can cause undesirable disturbances to the spacecraft platform, causing its
    attitude to change, potentially disrupting communication and solar energy
    collection processes as a result. Thus, coordinated control of both the
    spacecraft attitude and the manipulator motion become essential for
    successful space operations. Though past research has developed dynamic
    models for spacecraft manipulators, the contribution of reaction wheels to
    the angular momentum of the entire system needs further consideration. This
    paper reformulates the dynamic equations of a free-flying space robot by
    taking the aspect of reaction wheels into account. A diagonalization method
    is introduced to decouple the highly nonlinear multi-input/multi-output
    system model. A novel adaptive variable structure control method is then
    applied to implement a robust coordination controller for the space robot
    subjected to system uncertainties. Simulations are carried out on a
    spacecraft model with a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulator mounted on it to
    demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. Comparisons with
    sliding mode control show that the new controller results in faster settling
    times, which leads to maintaining uninterrupted communication links and
    efficient solar energy harvesting.

    We introduce a novel large-scale Digital Construction Platform (DCP) for
    on-site sensing, analysis, and fabrication. The DCP is an in-progress
    research project consisting of a compound robotic arm system comprised of a
    5-axis Altec hydraulic mobile boom arm attached to a 6-axis KUKA robotic
    arm. Akin to the biological model of human shoulder and hand this compound
    system utilizes the large boom arm for gross positioning and the small
    robotic arm for fine positioning and oscillation correction respectively.
    The platform is based on a fully mobile truck vehicle with a working reach
    diameter of over 80 feet. It can handle a 1,500 lb lift capacity and a 20 lb
    manipulation capacity. We report on the progress of the DCP and speculate on
    potential applications including fabrication of non-standard architectural
    forms, integration of real-time on-site sensing data, improvements in
    construction efficiency, enhanced resolution, lower error rates, and
    increased safety. We report on a case study for platform demonstration
    through large-scale 3D printing of insulative formwork for castable
    structures. We discuss benefits and potential future applications.

    Oscillation of crane payloads makes it challenging to manipulate payloads
    quickly, accurately, and safely. The problem is compounded when the payload
    creates a double-pendulum effect. This paper evaluates an input-shaping
    control method for reducing double-pendulum oscillations. Human operator
    performance testing on a 10-ton industrial bridge crane is used to verify
    the effectiveness and robustness of the method. Fifty operators drove the
    crane with a standard control pendent, as well as a wireless touchscreen
    interface. Data from these experiments show that human operators drive the
    crane much faster and safer with the input-shaping control scheme.
    Furthermore, considerably less operator effort is required when input
    shaping is used to limit the oscillation. Additional tests required the
    operators to drive the crane numerous times over a period of eight days.
    These experiments show that significant learning occurred when operators did
    not have the aid of input shaping. However, the performance never approached
    that achieved by untrained operators using input shaping.

    This paper describes an approach of the transporting and suppressing control
    of a rotating cargo for a jib crane. First, we show that the angle of the
    twisting cargo is measured using inertial measurement unit, and next
    proposed the gyro system with a control moment gyro implemented on the
    cargo. In experiments, we confirmed to transport the cargo with preventing
    the translational and twist sway using the gyro system.

  abstract: >-
    The rotation-controllable tower-crane hook block can control the horizontal
    rotation angle of a steel beam being lifted by a tower crane using a
    mechanical apparatus. It is expected that the mechanized hook block can
    relieve safety concerns; however, at the same time, there are several
    concerns: Is precise control of the rotation angle possible? Won't it be
    slower than rotating a beam by hand? If a mechanized system is faster, how
    fast is it? In order to test these, experiments were conducted. The
    precision of the rotating angle and the time for rotating and stopping the
    rotation controllable hook block were measured using an orientation sensor
    and a laser point. The results were compared to those of the conventional
    manual method. Since a steel beam usually has a symmetrical shape, π/2rad
    (=90°) is the maximum angle for placing a beam in the target location. The
    experiment results showed that a steel beam stopped after it moved 7π/600rad
    (=2.1°) and 9π/200rad (=8.1°) more, on average, due to inertia when the
    steel beam was rotated π/12rad (=15°) and π/2rad (=90°), respectively.
    However, it appeared that when an operator became used to the remote
    controller, the operator could reduce the rotation speed to stop a steel
    beam in the target location by reversing the motor direction. In terms of
    time, it took 5.80s, 8.69s, and 17.12s, on average, to rotate a steel beam
    π/12rad (=15°), π/4rad (=45°), and π/2rad (=90°), respectively. The time for
    rotating steel beams using the conventional manual method at a construction
    site was also measured for comparison. The rotation time using the
    conventional manual method ranged from 11.96s to 91.00s depending on how
    easy it was for workers to reach and rotate a beam because workers rotate
    beams while hanging on a column. The results showed that the deviation could
    be reduced and work efficiency could be improved when a mechanized hook
    block is adopted on a construction site.

    This paper presents an efficient method to capture the dynamic movement of a
    three-dimensional (3-D) overhead crane, enabling it to be controlled by
    visual feedback in real time with two cheap handy cameras. Two tracking
    areas and one positioning block in each frame are used to search image
    features and determine the useful vision information. The depth information
    of 3-D crane system in images can be also obtained by a tag on the dynamic
    plant. The presented visual tracking method involves comparison of the
    lightest or darkest points in the tracking or positioning area of a dynamic
    object and then computes the necessary trolley position and load swing in
    3-D space. Upon tracking, the sensing data are sent to an adaptive fuzzy
    sliding-mode controller (AFSMC) to derive control power for the crane
    system. Accordingly, the merits of this AFSMC approach, including robustness
    of the sliding-mode control and the model-free property of the fuzzy logic
    for the 3-D crane system, are confirmed. Experimental results verify the
    improvement of the proposed methodology.

    The goal of this book is to serve both as a practical technical reference
    and a resource for gaining a fuller understanding of the state of the art of
    spacecraft momentum control systems, specifically looking at control moment
    gyroscopes (CMGs). As a result, the subject matter includes theory,
    technology, and systems engineering. The authors combine material on
    system-level architecture of spacecraft that feature momentum-control
    systems with material about the momentum-control hardware and software. This
    also encompasses material on the theoretical and algorithmic approaches to
    the control of space vehicles with CMGs. In essence, CMGs are the
    attitude-control actuators that make contemporary highly agile spacecraft
    possible. The rise of commercial Earth imaging, the advances in privately
    built spacecraft (including small satellites), and the growing popularity of
    the subject matter in academic circles over the past decade argues that now
    is the time for an in-depth treatment of the topic. CMGs are augmented by
    reaction wheels and related algorithms for steering all such actuators,
    which together comprise the field of spacecraft momentum control systems.
    The material is presented at a level suitable for practicing engineers and
    those with an undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, and/or
    aerospace engineering.

    Falls are an urgent challenge in aging societies, and balance dysfunction is
    a major risk factor. Current robotic technology that assists human
    locomotion, however, aims at versatile functionality, particularly in the
    assistance of weak muscles. Such versatile design leads to heavy, bulky
    devices that are impractical in daily life for most elderly subjects. In
    this paper, we investigate the use of minimalistic robotic technology that
    focuses exclusively on stabilizing human balance during gait. This
    task-specific device is novel in its combination of portability and
    simplicity. Our initial simulations show that it is possible to return a
    person to a vertical position from an engagement angle of 10 degrees from
    vertical.

    Analysis of a 3D spatial double physical pendulum system, coupled by two
    universal joints is performed. External excitation of the mechanism is
    realized by axial periodic rotations of the first joint of the pendulum.
    System of ODEs is solved numerically and obtained data are analyzed by a
    standard approach, including time series, phase plots and Poincaré sections.
    Additionally, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform and the wavelet transformation
    algorithms have been applied. Various wavelet basic functions have been
    compared to find the best fit, e.g. Morlet, Mexican Hat and Gabor wavelets.
    The so far obtained results allowed for detection of a number of non-linear
    effects, including chaos, quasi-periodic and periodic dynamics, as well the
    numerous and different bifurcations. Scenarios of transition from regular to
    chaotic dynamics have been also illustrated and studied.

    The research presented here investigates techniques and tools for design and
    fabrication of tensile structures with flying robots. Tensile aggregations
    are described as a concatenation of nodes and links. Computational tools
    provide the designer of such a structure with the necessary aid to simulate,
    sequence and evaluate a design before fabrication. Using a prototypical
    suspension footbridge as an example, this paper describes the techniques and
    challenges for implementing the construction method on a full-scale,
    loadbearing, architectural artefact. Firstly, a series of tensile links is
    fabricated at defined lengths between two distant support structures to
    build the primary elements of the bridge. Secondly, cooperating flying
    robots brace the assembly by braiding the primary elements to one another.
    And finally, the structure is stabilized through the fabrication of
    additional connections by robots flying around existing elements within the
    porous structure.

    <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The overhead trolley of a gantry crane can be
    moved in two directions in the plane. The trolley is attempting to control
    the motion of a suspended, rigid-body, distributed mass load, supported by a
    hook, modelled as a lumped mass, in turn connected to the trolley by a light
    flexible cable. This flexible system has six degrees of freedom, four
    variables describing the flexible, hanging load dynamics and two (directly
    controlled) input variables for the trolley position. The equations of
    motion are developed and the crane model is verified. Then a form of
    wave-based control (WBC) is applied to determine what trolley motion should
    be used to achieve a reference motion of the load, with minimum swing during
    complex manoeuvres. Despite the trolley's limited control authority over the
    complex, flexible 3-D dynamics, WBC enables the trolley to achieve very good
    motion control of the load, in a simple, robust and rapid way, using little
    sensor information, with all measurements taken at or close to the
    trolley.</p>

  abstract: >-
    This paper presents a comparative study about the attitude control methods
    based on four commonly used error indicators, namely the triad of 3-2-1
    deviational Euler angles, the error quaternion, the deviational angle–axis
    pair and the orientation error matrix. These error indicators are used here
    with the same backstepping control law to have a common basis of comparison.
    This control law makes the controller track a restoring angular velocity
    generated here specifically for each error indicator. This comparative study
    shows that all these error indicators can be used satisfactorily even in the
    critical orientations associated with them by taking special measures. For
    the deviational Euler angle triad, a critical orientation is a singularity,
    at which the angles become indefinite. Unless the vehicle is stationary,
    this indefiniteness is resolved here by applying L’Hopital’s Rule on the
    angular velocity information. The Euler angle triad has also a multiplicity
    problem. It is solved here by using the novel criterion of minimal deviation
    angles. For the other error indicators, a critical orientation is an
    antipodal orientation, which is opposite to the desired one. In an antipodal
    orientation, the error quaternion and the deviational angle–axis pair cannot
    be determined through the customary formulas. They are determined here by
    using the novel specially introduced formulas. Besides, they may suffer from
    the unwinding phenomenon in an ordinary orientation. This phenomenon is
    prevented here by keeping the scalar part of the error quaternion
    non-negative and the deviation angle between 0° and 180°. For the
    orientation error matrix, a stationary and undisturbed antipodal orientation
    is an unstable equilibrium, in which the ordinary backstepping control law
    becomes ineffective for driving the system into action. This problem is
    solved here by adding an extra term to the ordinary backstepping control
    law.

    The load of overhead cranes are attached to the mechanical structure with a
    rope, consequently the trajectory of the load cannot be actuated directly.
    This results in an unwanted oscillatory behaviour, which needs to be damped
    for the effective and safe transportation. In existing automated cranes,
    control solutions suggest state-feedback law. In previous work we proposed
    an estimation algorithm employing the unscented Kalman filter for the
    calculation of the unmeasured states. Because of the stiction, this method
    becomes inaccurate when the trolley does not move. In this paper we suggest
    the application of a pair of laser slot sensors for detecting when the rope
    is close to the vertical. Incremental encoders are used to measure the
    displacement of the trolley and the length of the rope. Since the detection
    of the vertical rope angle is asynchronous w.r.t. the sampling instant, an
    appropriate sensor fusion technique is provided. The effectiveness of the
    estimation method is verified on a real laboratory crane setup.

    We investigate a variation of the simple double pendulum in which the two
    point masses are replaced by square plates. The double square pendulum
    exhibits richer behavior than the simple double pendulum and provides a
    convenient demonstration of nonlinear dynamics and chaos. It is also an
    example of an asymmetric compound double pendulum, which has not been
    studied in detail. We obtain the equilibrium configurations and normal modes
    of oscillation and derive the equations of motion, which are solved
    numerically to produce Poincaré sections. We show how the behavior varies
    from regular motion at low energies, to chaos at intermediate energies, and
    back to regular motion at high energies. We also show that the onset of
    chaos occurs at a significantly lower energy than for the simple double
    pendulum.

    SummarySpace robotics will become a key technology for the exploration of
    outer space and the operation and maintenance of space stations, satellites
    and other platforms, saving costs and relieving man from dangerous tasks.
    But we do not have to wait until robots are really autonomous or
    intelligent, since by modern teleoperation and telepresence we are able to
    remotely control robot systems from the ground in the sense of “prolonging
    man’s arm into space”. Humans, with their several hundred thousand years of
    evolution, will not adapt themselves to the hostile space environment,
    whilst robots, which have only been developed for just over 40 years, can be
    much more easily adapted to such an environment. As presented within this
    work, few pioneering telerobotic experiments like ROTEX, the first remotely
    controlled space robot system, ETS-VII, the first free-floating space robot
    experiment, or ROKVISS, Germany’s recent advanced space robot experiment on
    the International Space Station, have been proposed and conducted on the way
    towards a space robot assistant system for the usage as an artificial
    astronaut to perform On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) tasks.

    In this study, the CMG (control moment gyro) subsystem, a new type of
    construction machinery using the mechanism of CMG, for the attitude control
    of an unstructured object such as a beam carried by a tower crane, is
    designed and implemented. The CMG subsystem consists of one motor for
    spinning the wheel, and the other motor for turning the outer gimbal. As an
    input of the system, applying force to the spin axis of the wheel leads the
    torque about the axis, whereas the wheel is spinning at high speed. This
    torque is used to control the attitude of the unstructured object in this
    study. For the stabilizer function, in addition, holding the load at the
    current position, the power applied to the gimbal motor of CMG will be cut,
    which results in a braking force to stop the load by the gyro effect. The
    CMG subsystem the authors developed consists of the mechanical system, a
    remote controller, a servo controller and control software for the system.
    The authors also present experimental results to show that the system they
    proposed is useful as construction machinery which can control the attitude
    of the beam hanging from a tower crane.

    It is essential to have the ability to control the attitude of a spacecraft
    while an onboard robotic manipulator is operating. The paper presents a
    comprehensive dynamic model for a reaction wheel actuated spacecraft and a
    robust controller that can maintain the attitude of the spacecraft as
    required while the manipulator follows the desired trajectory. Unlike
    previous work, this paper reformulates the dynamic equation of a Free-Flying
    Space Robot (FFSR) with actuating Reaction Wheels (RWs) by taking into
    account the contribution of RWs to the angular momentum of the entire
    system. Given strong nonlinearities and multiple inputs of the system,
    diagonalization is first used to transform the strongly coupled problem into
    multiple single-input problems by introducing virtual torques. When
    involving system uncertainties, the defined virtual torque is accurately
    associated with the actual torque using nominal value of the uncertain
    inertia matrix in order to guarantee stability of original system. Smoothed
    Sliding Mode (SMC) controllers are designed for each single-input system
    provided that the bounds of uncertainties can be estimated. A spacecraft
    mounted with a 3-DOF manipulator is used in simulation to demonstrate the
    robustness of the control law when applied to space manipulators.

    Large amplitude oscillation of crane payloads is detrimental to safe and
    efficient operation. Under certain conditions, the problem is compounded
    when the payload creates a double-pendulum effect. Most crane control
    research to date has focused on single-pendulum dynamics. Several
    researchers have shown that single-mode oscillations can be greatly reduced
    by properly shaping the inputs to the crane motors. This paper builds on
    those previous developments to create a method for suppressing
    double-pendulum payload oscillations. The input shaping controller is
    designed to have robustness to changes in the two operating frequencies.
    Experiments performed on a portable bridge crane are used to verify the
    effectiveness of this method and the robustness of the input shaper.

    The payload oscillation inherent to all cranes makes it challenging for
    human operators to manipulate pay-loads quickly, accurately, and safely.
    Under certain conditions, the problem is compounded when the payload creates
    a double-pendulum effect. This paper presents an input-shaping control
    method for suppressing double-pendulum payload oscillations. Local and
    teleoperation experiments performed on a portable tower crane are used to
    verify the effectiveness of the method. Data from these experiments show
    that operators performed manipulation tasks faster and safer when input
    shaping was utilized to reduce payload sway. Furthermore, the teleoperation
    delays did not degrade the input shaping effectiveness.

  abstract: >-
    The use of robots in architectural construction has been a research field
    since the 1980s. Driven by both productive and creative concerns, different
    systems have been devised based on large-scale robotic structures, mobile
    robotic units or flying robotic vehicles. By analyzing these approaches and
    discussing their advantages and limitations, this paper presents an
    alternative strategy to automate the building construction processes in
    on-site scenarios. The SPIDERobot is a cable-robot system developed to
    perform assembly operations, which is driven by a specific Feedback Dynamic
    Control System (FDCS) based on a vision system. By describing and
    illustrating this research work, the authors argue about the advantages of
    this cable robot system to deal with the complexity and the scale of
    building construction in architecture.

  abstract: >-
    We consider active gyroscopic stabilisation of unstable bodies such as
    two-wheeled monorails, two-wheeled cars, or unmanned bicycles. It has been
    speculated that gyroscopically stabilised monorail cars would have economic
    advantages with respect to birail cars, enabling the cars to take sharper
    curves and traverse steeper terrain, with lower installation and maintenance
    costs. A two-wheeled, gyro-stabilised car was actually constructed in 1913.
    The dynamic stabilisation of a monorail car or two-wheeled automobile
    requires that a torque acting on the car from the outside be neutralised by
    a torque produced within the car by a gyroscope. The gyroscope here is used
    as an actuator, not a sensor, by using precession forces generated by the
    gyroscope. When torque is applied to an axis normal to the spin axis,
    causing the gyroscope to precess, a moment is produced about a third axis,
    orthogonal to both the torque and spin axes. As the vehicle tilts from
    vertical, a precession-inducing torque is applied to the gyroscope cage such
    that the resulting gyroscopic reaction moment will tend to right the
    vehicle. The key idea is that motion of the gyroscope relative to the body
    is actively controlled in order to generate a stabilising moment. This
    problem was considered in 1905 by Louis Brennan (1905, see ref. 1). Many
    extensions were later developed, including the work by Shilovskii (1924, see
    ref. 2), and several prototypes were built. The differences in the various
    schemes lie in the number of gyroscopes employed, the direction of the spin
    axes relative to the rail, and in the method used to produce precession of
    the spin axes. We start by deriving the equations of motion for a case where
    the system is formed of a vehicle, a load placed on the vehicle, the
    gyroscope wheel, and a gyroscope cage. We allow for track curvature and
    vehicle speed. We then derive the equations for a similar system with two
    gyroscopes, spinning in opposite directions and such that the precession
    angles are opposite. We linearise the dynamics about a set of equilibrium
    points and develop a linearised model. We study the stability of the
    linearised systems and show simulation results. Finally, we discuss a scaled
    gyrovehicle model and testing.

  abstract: >-
    In practical applications, industrial cranes may exhibit double-pendulum
    swing effects, due to many factors, such as large payload scales and
    non-negligible hook masses. Currently, for double-pendulum cranes, most
    available methods are open-loop controllers designed based on linearized
    crane dynamics; even for existing closed-loop approaches, they are also
    mostly developed using linearized dynamics and require the exact knowledge
    of system parameters, which makes them sensitive to parametric
    uncertainties. To handle these issues, we present an adaptive antiswing
    control strategy for crane systems with double-pendulum swing effects and
    uncertain/unknown parameters, which can make the trolley accurately reach
    the target position with reduced overshoots and effectively eliminate the
    double-pendulum swing angles at the same time. A complete stability
    analysis, based upon the full nonlinear dynamics (i.e., without linearizing
    the dynamics), is included to support the theoretical derivations. We
    present hardware experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed
    controller achieves better performance than existing ones and exhibits good
    robustness.

    electronic sway control for bridge cranes


    - Avoids harmful load peaks. Mechanical stress on electrical and mechanical
    parts is reduced (less maintenance)

    - Crane is easy to operate with optimal crane movements

    - Operator's focus is in controlling the load movement and not the hoist or
    crane movement

    - Time is not lost because of  increased load swing and extended time to
    place the load, the load handling is therefore more efficient

  abstract: >-
    The "Zero-G" is designated as a new class of underwater robot that is
    capable of unrestricted attitude control. A novel control scheme based on
    internal actuation using control moment gyros (CMGs) is developed to provide
    Zero-G class autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with this unique freedom
    in control. This is implemented in the CMG-actuated Zero-G class internal
    kinematic underwater robot actuation (IKURA) system that was developed as
    part of this research. A series of experiments are performed to demonstrate
    the practical application of CMGs and verify the associated theoretical
    developments. The ability to actively stabilize the translational dynamics
    of the robot is assessed and unrestricted attitude control is demonstrated
    in an experiment that involves vertically pitched diving and surfacing in
    surge. Finally, potential applications for Zero-G class AUVs are discussed.

    Logistics operations such as ship-to-ship cargo transfer on the high seas
    can be impaired by dangerous crane load oscillations induced by the
    prevailing sea state. In efforts to measure and characterize the ship and
    crane load motions for potential control algorithm identification, a system
    of fiber optic (FO) high-performance, low-frequency accelerometers and an
    optical radar are used. Data from these subsystems are concatenated,
    controlled, and analyzed in the LabVIEW virtual instrument environment. A
    1:24 scale model test of the cargo transfer scenario was conducted, and some
    results from a preliminary (dry) test are presented in this work. Results
    indicate the existence of relatively long transient dynamics modes and
    complex chaotic behavior in a region near primary crane load swing
    resonance, Brief mention is also given of a phase-sensitive detection
    technique that can be used to analyze the data.

    In this paper, issues of the Coriolis force impact on the operation of the
    tower crane swing mechanism during the starting period under combination of
    working motions (boom swing and outreach increase) are considered.
    Quantitative dependencies of the parameters characterizing the mechanism
    starting mode on the velocity of load trolley travel along the boom and wind
    load are provided. Diagrams of these dependencies conveniently illustrate a
    noticeable decrease in the crane output upon adverse combination of factors
    related to the occurring Coriolis acceleration. More specically, if the
    perpendicularly directed heavy wind load inuences the boom in case of
    combination of working motions of the boom swing and outreach change, the
    starting time constituting the most part of the operating time of the swing
    mechanism can increase by 20 and more percent. The corresponding methodology
    of the calculation investigation is also stated in the paper

  abstract: >-
    The usefulness of cranes is limited because the payload is supported by an
    overhead suspension cable that allows oscillation to occur during crane
    motion. Under certain conditions, the payload dynamics may introduce an
    additional oscillatory mode that creates a double pendulum. This paper
    presents an analysis of this effect on tower cranes. This paper also reviews
    a command generation technique to suppress the oscillatory dynamics with
    robustness to frequency changes. Experimental results are presented to
    verify that the proposed method can improve the ability of crane operators
    to drive a double-pendulum tower crane. The performance improvements
    occurred during both local and teleoperated control.

    Cable-driven parallel robots allow for fast motions and huge workspaces,
    using relatively lightweight moving masses and low-power actuation. This
    kind of structure yields usually very cost-effective solutions. However, the
    wider the workspace, the lower the equivalent stiffness of the end-effector
    yielding inaccuracies due mainly to unwanted vibrations. In this paper, we
    propose a new approach to compensate for these vibrations. Reaction wheels
    are used to cancel rotational oscillations of the platform. A planar
    cable-driven robot built with cheap and lightweight Lego Mindstorms parts is
    used to validate the concept.

  abstract: >-
    Compared to other parallel robots, cable-driven parallel robots can achieve
    bigger workspace, higher dynamics with lighter parts and fewer energy while
    being economically competitive. However, such robots with big workspaces are
    affected either by cable sagging or by a very low end-effector stiffness,
    both causing positioning errors. With lightweight cables, the very low
    stiffness yields disturbing vibrations. In this paper, we address the
    problem of decoupled active canceling of those vibrations in the modal
    space. In modal space, vibrations are decomposed in orthogonal signals which
    allows to use simple SISO control methods to build an active vibration
    canceling algorithm for the end-effector. As the modal space depends on the
    end-effector position, better performances are achieved if the controller is
    tuned for the current robot position. The proposed method is tested both on
    a realistic simulation and on a 8-cables and 6-degrees of freedom robot.

    This paper presents a position control problem for an under actuated
    overhead crane system, which has two degrees of freedom with only one
    actuator for trolley driving. An overhead crane transfers a work piece to a
    desired position while keeping the swing angle of the work piece small
    during this process. The rope should not have a swing angle at the load
    destination. In this paper, five controllers (i.e., linear and nonlinear
    controllers) are derived based on the passivity of the system. The total
    energy of the system and its square are used in a Lyapunov candidate
    function to design the controllers. The equilibrium point of the closed loop
    is proven asymptotically stable by the Lyapunov technique and LaSalle
    invariance theorem. The optimal linear controller is combined to force the
    swing angle to converge rapidly to zero by reaching the trolley location.
    Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted by using the test bed
    model to evaluate the controllers.

    This paper is concerned with the coordination tracking control for space
    manipulator system with internal model uncertainties and external
    environment disturbances. A novel robust anti -disturbance coordination
    control scheme is proposed to realize feed-forward control of the base
    satellite attitude and precise trajectory tracking of the manipulator. The
    composite controller is composed of disturbance observer based controller
    (DOBC), H∞ feedback controller and computed-momentum based reaction
    compensation (CMRC) controller; where the DOBC estimate and compensate the
    external disturbances, the H∞ feedback controller attenuate the internal
    model uncertainties, then the computed-momentum based reaction compensation
    (CMRC) controller is designed as a feed-forward coordination controller to
    actively anticipate the manipulator reaction and compensate for it in

  abstract: >-
    The spatial double inverted pendulum actuated at the hip, but not at the
    foot, may be considered to be a model of standing creatures and robots.
    Moving in-space, as opposed to in-plane, poses new control problems which,
    for the most part, are still open. In this paper, a hybrid approach where an
    energy-shaping, passivity-based swing-up controller hands oﬀ the control to
    a linear-quadratic-regulator in the vicinity of the unstable upright
    equilibrium is proposed. A direct approach and a pre-compensated approach
    are described, discussed, and illustrated by means of examples in
    simulation.

  abstract: >-
    After being launched into space to perform some tasks, the inertia
    parameters of a space robotic system may change due to fuel consumption,
    hardware reconfiguration, target capturing, and so on. For precision control
    and simulation, it is required to identify these parameters on orbit. This
    paper proposes an effective method for identifying the complete inertia
    parameters (including the mass, inertia tensor and center of mass position)
    of a space robotic system. The key to the method is to identify two types of
    simple dynamics systems: equivalent single-body and two-body systems. For
    the former, all of the joints are locked into a designed configuration and
    the thrusters are used for orbital maneuvering. The object function for
    optimization is defined in terms of acceleration and velocity of the
    equivalent single body. For the latter, only one joint is unlocked and
    driven to move along a planned (exiting) trajectory in free-floating mode.
    The object function is defined based on the linear and angular momentum
    equations. Then, the parameter identification problems are transformed into
    non-linear optimization problems. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
    algorithm is applied to determine the optimal parameters, i.e. the complete
    dynamic parameters of the two equivalent systems. By sequentially unlocking
    the 1st to nth joints (or unlocking the nth to 1st joints), the mass
    properties of body 0 to n (or n to 0) are completely identified. For the
    proposed method, only simple dynamics equations are needed for
    identification. The excitation motion (orbit maneuvering and joint motion)
    is also easily realized. Moreover, the method does not require prior
    knowledge of the mass properties of any body. It is general and practical
    for identifying a space robotic system on-orbit.

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, both the closed-form dynamics and adaptive robust tracking
    control of a space robot with two-link flexible manipulators under unknown
    disturbances are developed. The dynamic model of the system is described
    with assumed modes approach and Lagrangian method. The flexible manipulators
    are represented as Euler–Bernoulli beams. Based on singular perturbation
    technique, the displacements/joint angles and flexible modes are modelled as
    slow and fast variables, respectively. A sliding mode control is designed
    for trajectories tracking of the slow subsystem under unknown but bounded
    disturbances, and an adaptive sliding mode control is derived for slow
    subsystem under unknown slowly time-varying disturbances. An optimal linear
    quadratic regulator method is proposed for the fast subsystem to damp out
    the vibrations of the flexible manipulators. Theoretical analysis validates
    the stability of the proposed composite controller. Numerical simulation
    results demonstrate the performance of the closed-loop flexible space robot
    system.

  abstract: >-
    There are two theoretical methods by which a two wheeled vehicle oriented in
    tandem can be stabilized: dynamic stabilization and control moment gyroscope
    (CMG) stabilization. Dynamic stabilization utilizes tactical steering
    techniques to trigger a lean in the vehicle in the intended direction for
    balancing, while CMG stabilization employs the reactive precession torque of
    a high speed flywheel about an axis that will act to balance the vehicle. Of
    these two, CMG stabilization offers greater advantages for static vehicles.
    This paper proposes a first order sliding mode controller (SMC) design to
    control the CMG and stabilize a bicycle at zero-forward velocity. This study
    also compares the SMC method to a PID controller to validate the advantages
    of the SMC controller for the highly non-linear system dynamics of static
    stabilization. The result of two experimental setups are presented and
    discussed. The first experimental platform is a single degree of freedom
    (DOF) inverted pendulum and the second is a three DOF bicycle.

    An Attitude Control and Stabilization of an Unstructured Object using CMG
    Subsystem CMG;Gyro actuator;gyro effect;piezoelectric vibrating gyroscope
    sensor;PID control; In this paper, we propose an attitude controller for an
    unstructured object using CMG(Control Moment of Gyro) subsystem, which has a
    stabilizer function. The CMG subsystem consists of one motor for spinning
    the wheel and the other motor for turning the outer gimbal. While the wheel
    of CMG subsystem is spinning at high speed, applying force to the spin axis
    of the wheel leads the torque about the vertical axis. We utilize the torque
    to control the attitude of object in this study. For the stabilizer
    function, in additiion, holding the load at the current position, the power
    applied to the gimbal motor of CMG will be cut, which result in the braking
    force to stop the load by gyro effect. However, due to the gear reduction
    connected to outer gimbal, slow load motion cannot generate the braking
    force. Thus, in this study, we are willing to make a holding force by
    applying control power to the gimbal motor from the signal of piezoelectric
    gyroscopic sensor that detected the angular velocity of the load. These two
    features are demonstrated in experiment, carrying a beam with crane. As a
    result, load was started to rotate by controlling gimbal positiion and was
    stopped by turning off the gimbal power. Moreover, slow movement of the load
    was also rejected by additional control with gyroscopic sensor.

  abstract: >-
    It is well known that the attitude control of an object hanging with wire is
    not easy by using usual actuators. Even though an actuator such as a fan can
    be used for controlling the object it is difficult to meet the desired
    control objective. For these reasons, we propose a gyro actuator constructed
    with two motors. The first motor is responsible for spinning the wheel at
    high speed and the second motor is used to turn the outer gimbal. By
    applying the torque to the second motor, which results in the turn of the
    outer gimbal, the torque about the vertical axis can be obtained while the
    wheel of the gyro is spinning constantly. This torque is used to control the
    attitude of the object attached. The aim of this paper is to derive the
    transfer function of the actuator and show the usefulness. Experiments to
    the prototype model using a state feedback control and PID control are
    conducted to show the usefulness of the proposed gyro actuator.

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, we consider the finite-time regulation controller for the
    underactuated crane systems in 2-dimensional (2D) space with both constant
    cable length and varying cable length. The differential-flatness-based
    approach is applied to the development of finite-time control laws. The
    elegantly designed controller can simultaneously suppress the payload swing
    and regulate the trolley to the desired destination within a finite time for
    the 2D bridge crane system in the case of constant cable length. Considering
    cable length variation, the flatness-based tracking controller is presented
    meticulously in a separately two-step program. Specifically, the finite-time
    technique is first used to achieve the simultaneous motion regulation and
    payload swing suppression and elimination within a finite time. Then, we
    propose a Lyapunov-based tracking control method, under which the cable can
    track a predefined trajectory. Simulation results are provided to
    demonstrate both the efficiency and the robustness against external
    disturbances of the addressed control algorithms.

  abstract: >-
    In this paper, a novel online motion planning method for double-pendulum
    overhead cranes is proposed. The proposed trajectory is made up of two
    parts: anti-sway component and trolley positioning component. The objective
    of the first part is to suppress and eliminate the swings of hook and
    payload. Lyapunov techniques, LaSalle’s invariance theorem, and Barbalat’s
    lemma are used to demonstrate that the trolley can be driven to arrive at
    the desired position, while the unexpected hook swing and payload swing are
    damped out simultaneously with the proposed trajectory. Numerical simulation
    results indicate that the proposed control trajectory achieves superior
    performance and admits strong robustness against parameter variations and
    external disturbances.
