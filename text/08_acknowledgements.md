This work was made possible, supported and accompanied by many great people.

A massive thank you to Sigrid for giving me this challenging project, for setting the bar high and trusting in me.
You gave me incredible opportunities and room to learn and grow.

Thank you to all of my fellow researchers, colleagues and student assistants at our chair. Amazing amounts of talent and ideas -- it was inspiring to work with you all.
In particular I want to thank Elisa and Sven for being there through thick and thin.
I will always remember fondly our many discussions and achievements.

Our chair would not be what it is without the amazing mix of people that got drawn to it and this project was supported by several of them.
I will be forever indebted to Kaveh for making him suffer the many foibles of Simulink.
He persevered and managed to get our prototype running.
A prototype that would not exist without the great work of our student assistants Felix and Pascal.
And most recently Davide joined us and I got to spend an incredibly insightful week handing over the project.

Thank you to my father for teaching me what a PhD is actually about and my mother for teaching me early on not to turn everything into a Doktorarbeit (I get it now).
She also did an incredible job at proofreading and editing this work.

Thank you to the gladiators, whom one day I will defeat.

And above all, thank you Eva.

The original idea and subsequent work contained in this thesis have been submitted as a patent application [@HaarhoffVorrichtungZurSteuerung].
Therefore many of the ideas and solutions in this thesis are part of that application, in particular the integrated approach of using CMGs to turn cranes into stable platforms for automation.

A theoretical validation of the fundamental approach was published as part of the MTM Robotics 2016 [@HaarhoffActuatorDesignStabilizing2016].
