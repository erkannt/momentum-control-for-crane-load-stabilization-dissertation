# We are going to need a bigger robot

- robots are actors and bridge from the digital to the real
- we need robots i.e. controlled positions and motions at construction site scale
- controlled action is the first step towards automation
- cranes are biggest workspace >> rope is key >> rope can't transmit force >> we are in space
- alternative approaches for large workspaces
  - parallel tendon
  - drones
  - propulsion
  - telescopes and scissors
  - climbers
