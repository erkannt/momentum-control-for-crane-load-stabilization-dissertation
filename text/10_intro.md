# Introduction

The following is a documentation of efforts to understand whether it would be possible to operate a robot hanging from a crane.
Instead of using parallel tendon kinematics, i.e. additional ropes, this work studies how the hook might be stabilized using control moment gyroscopes and the torque they can provide.

This project was initiated by and took place at the relatively young chair for _Individualized Production in Architecture_.
The chair is part of the architecture faculty, but also includes researchers from computer science, mechanical as well as civil engineering disciplines.
We believe the interaction between such interdisciplinary capabilities to be essential to solving many of the problems facing our built environment.

Therefore this thesis aims not only to be of use to other engineers well versed in dynamic systems and their control.
Instead the intention is that, by covering certain fundamentals in greater detail, this work will be of use to architects, civil engineers and roboticists alike enabling them to understand the potentials and challenges of hanging a robot from a crane.
With this in mind, the following work contains a basic introduction to control moment gyroscopes, models for the simulation of the crane-CMG robot system as well as tools for the sizing of CMGs for crane applications.

------------

The original idea and subsequent work contained in this thesis have been submitted as a patent application [@HaarhoffVorrichtungZurSteuerung].
Therefore many of the ideas and solutions in this thesis are part of that application, in particular the integrated approach of using CMGs to turn cranes into stable plattforms for automation.

A theoretical validation of the fundamental approach was published as part of the MTM Robotics 2016 [@HaarhoffActuatorDesignStabilizing2016].

## The Need for Construction Robots

Construction is and will continue to face significant challenges:
Our urban population is rising [@PopulationDivision-UnitedNationsWorldUrbanizationProspects], necessitating not only the creation of significant amounts of new building stock, but also the densification and upgrading of existing stock.
Furthermore we must reduce the impact on the environment of our buildings and their use.
At the same time climate change has already resulted in increasingly extreme weather conditions and changes to the climate conditions that our buildings have to withstand.
Many so called developed nations are also facing shortages in skilled construction workers [@MorrisonConstructionLaborShortage], not only due to the aging population and unattractive working conditions, but also due to reliance on cheap foreign labour.
The latter has caused many sectors in construction to stagnate technologically as innovation was more costly than masses of cheap labour [@ArntzDigitalisierungUndZukunft].

Fortunately, technological advances have led other industries to develop means for greater individualization and increased flexibility in their production.
Looking at earlier attempts at automating construction (particularly in Japan and Korea during the 80s), one can see how the technology of the day was unable to provide said individualization and flexibility required in construction[@BockConstructionRobotsElementary2016, @BockRoboticIndustrializationAutomation2015, @BockSiteAutomationAutomated2016].
With robots, sensors and fast computing becoming more ubiquitous, we are finally seeing the renaissance of construction robotics.

The first examples of these new on-site, commercially available robots were [SAM100](https://www.construction-robotics.com/) the brick-laying robot and [Tybot](https://www.tybotllc.com/) the rebar-tying robot for bridge decks.
Robots have also entered the preproduction of buildings and we are slowly seeing more direct links between digital planning and individualized robotic execution.
As industrial robots enter the construction industry, the existing construction machinery is also becoming more sophisticated.
Dump trucks are already driving autonomously in open pit mines and excavators and other machines are being fitted with sensors and digital controls.

The availability of digitally-controllable machinery has always been key to increasing automation and individualization.
Such machines are the bridge from digital planning to execution in the real world.
As such it is wonderful to see the emergence of programmable machines suited for the construction site.
Yet one aspect of the construction site is not addressed by the existing range of adapted industrial robots and upgraded construction machinery: the sheer size of construction sites.

## Turning Cranes into Robots

The ability of cranes to provide logistics over large spans and at great heights has transformed construction since antiquity.
They are the kinematic systems of choice for the large of scale of construction sites, naval operations and large scale assembly tasks.
However, the key to their success is also the reason for the limitation of their automation.
Using a rope as the last link of their kinematic chain, cranes are able to cover height with a minimum of material.
The flexibility of the rope also means that it requires extremely little space when retracted, as it can be coiled and wound around winches.
Yet this flexibility also means that the rope cannot be used to push, only to pull.
With the actors (the motors) of the crane connected to the end effector (the hook) via a flexible connection, it is difficult to produce controlled motion in the event of disturbances.
If robots are to be used over the large work area of the construction site effectively, they must be provided with a stable work platform.

TODO: elaborate on instability and how a robot introduces disturbance

![Overview of forces preventing stable operation of e.g. a robot suspended from a crane: a) center of gravity (CoG) of the hook/platform moves out of equilibrium, b) robot CoG gets moved out of equilibrium, c) forces and torques acting at robot base due to motion of robot, d) forces and torques stemming from interaction with external objects, e) external forces e.g. wind. Note that these all interact.](./figures/crane-robot-forces.svg){short-caption="Forces acting on a robot hanging from a crane"}

### Momentum Control Devices

Such a platform must be capable of compensating the torques and forces acting on the base of the robot as it performs its task.
If we wish to use the proven technology of construction cranes, we need to find a way of creating counteracting forces and torques in the middle of space.
Fortunately, spacecraft face a similar issues, having to maneuver without having land or air to push off from.
Whilst spacecraft are usually known for their use of rocket and other propulsive devices, they also usually have means of producing torque without expending fuel.
This feat is achieved through momentum control devices and this work will discuss the feasibility of using a specific type of these, called control moment gyroscopes, to enable construction robots for large work envelopes.

TODO: note which chapter will discuss what

### Alternative Approaches

Prior to looking at momentum control devices in greater detail, this section will cover some of the alternatives for large workspace kinematics.

A well studied approach are parallel tendon kinematics.
Here, instead of a single rope positioning the end effector, multiple ropes/tendons are used.
By spanning these tendons from different directions, it becomes possible to create stable positions and motions over large spaces.
Such systems are commercially available for cameras in sports stadiums and researchers have proposed their use for a variety of other tasks.

The RoboCrane was originally a DARPA project at NIST that was proposed for several applications [@james1993nist] including construction [@LytleIntelligentJobSite2003; @GoodwinRoboCraneConstructionBridges1997].
Other systems such as the Fraunhofer Instituteâ€™s IPAnema have been aimed at logistics [@PottIPAnemaFamilyCableDriven2013].
More recently there have also been further conceptual proposals for the use of parallel tendon robots on construction sites [@SousaSPIDERobotCableRobotSystem2016] as well as large scale 3D-printing efforts that utilize parallel tendon research prototypes [@IzardLargescale3DPrinting2017] (see @Fig:parallel-tendon-print).

![Rendering of a 3D-printing concept for construction sites [@IzardLargescale3DPrinting2017]](./figures/parallel-tendon-printing-izard.png){ #fig:parallel-tendon-print short-caption="Rendering of a 3D-printing construction site concept"}

Parallel tendon kinematics come with some challenges and disadvantages.
Dealing with tendon elasticity is particularly relevant to vibrations in the system.
Depending on the size of the end effector platform, the systems will also struggle to produce high torques, as these depend on the amount of leverage that the tendons have on the platform.
Some researchers have therefore added momentum control devices to compensate torques in parallel tendon kinematics [@WeberActiveVibrationCanceling2014], which point to interesting hybrid approaches (see @Fig:reaction-wheel-tendon).
The bigger issue for construction sites will most likely be the need for the tendon's winches to be placed around the workspace of the system.
This means that tendons would be required to cross large areas of the construction site, which again would pose significant challenges with regard to collisions, setup costs as well as worker safety.

On the right, one can see them being used and rotating at the top of the platform.](./figures/reaction-wheel-tendon-gangloff.gif){ #fig:reaction-wheel-tendon short-caption="Parallel tendon plattform damplened with reaction wheels"}

Drones are the only system on a construction site with a workspace larger than cranes.
They are therefore seeing use as an inspection, surveying and monitoring tool.
They have also been proposed as a logistics and robotics platform for infrastructure (see [ARCAS EU Research Project](http://www.arcas-project.eu) and @Fig:flying-robot).
Given the weight of construction materials, dronesâ€™ small payload capabilities in comparison to cranes severely limits this approach.
Their need to compromise flight time with battery weight is an additional constraint of drone based approaches.
It seems relevant to point out that the building materials of some widely publicized drone-based constructions are foam blocks [@GramazioKohlerFlightAssembledArchitecture2011], nylon ropes [@MirjanBuildingBridgeFlying2016; @AugugliaroBuildingTensileStructures2013] and carbon fibers [@SollyICDITKEResearch2018].
The use of propulsive systems (e.g. propellors) to rotate or stabilize crane loads has been mentioned in the literature and apparently there were experiments made in Japan or Korea [@InouePracticalDevelopmentSuspender1998], but sadly the results of these experiments are not available.

The consortium also performed experiments with a kerosine-fueled drone/helicopter capable of carrying a DLR LBR robot arm.](./figures/arcas.gif){ #fig:flying-robot short-caption="EU ARCAS project on flying robots"}

While mobile platforms in robotics are starting to enter industrial use, they are not able to provide the vertical reach of cranes.
For small heights, linear axes can be added to the mobile platforms to increase the reach of their robot arms.
Some have proposed attaching industrial robot arms to other systems to enhance their reach and construction site mobility.
One example from research is the Digital Construction Platform by the MIT Media Lab [@KeatingCompoundArmApproach2014] (@Fig:dcp-media-lab).
Others have attached articulated arms to hydraulic remote controlled demolition robots for use in nuclear decommissioning [@BurrellFeedbackControlBased2016].
Apart from their vertical and horizontal reach, a further benefit of cranes can be their small footprint relative to their horizontal reach.
Mobile platforms, on the other hand, would have to be provided with access via the ground.

### Potential Applications

In comparison to the alternatives covered above, @Fig:baugrok-applications illustrates the potential abilities of the proposed system of stabilizing a crane hook with momentum control devices.
Generally speaking, it would add the ability to produce controlled torques at the hook of a crane without requiring any additional ropes or other kinematics.
The control moment gyroscopes would allow for the compensation of the torques produced by a robot's motion or other processes suspended from the hook.
They would also provide control over the rotation of parts during transport and assembly operations.
Furthermore they could assist in dampening crane oscillations.

These abilities could result in novel applications of cranes, not only on construction sites.
Components could be moved with greater control for logistics and assembly operations.
By increasing the control of the motion safe automation of such tasks becomes possible.
The ability to compensate provess torques also make it possible to use additional kinematic systems, be they specialized or general purpose e.g. industrial robots.
Examples of these applications are illustrated in @Fig:indoor-and-outdoor.
