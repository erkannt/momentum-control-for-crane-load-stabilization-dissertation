# We are going to need a bigger robot

## The Need for Construction Robots
- robots are actors and bridge from the digital to the real
- we need robots i.e. controlled positions and motions at construction site scale
- controlled action is the first step towards automation

## Turning Cranes into Robots
- cranes are biggest workspace >> rope is key >> rope can't transmit force >> we are in space
- alternative approaches for large workspaces
  - parallel tendon
  - drones
  - propulsion
  - telescopes and scissors
  - climbers

## Challenges for Robot Cranes

- flexible rope
  - lack of control authority
  - difficulty in sensing
- forces and torques

## Potential Applications

1. Process Compensation
2. Part Rotation
3. Pendulum Dampening

## Goal of Work

- evaluate potential of cmg-crane system
- provide understandable reference to bridge gap between users and technology providers
- sizing guideline
- tools for simulation and basic control
